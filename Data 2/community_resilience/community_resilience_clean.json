After  completing a vulnerability assessment, you will have identified the risks that have the highest potential to  affect your organizations ability to meet its goals.

Involving others will pay off in many ways as you develop your adaptation plan. You will learn what  topics potential partners are concerned about, who can contribute expertise, and whether you have  support for moving forward. The process described in this Workbook is well suited for a collaborative  approach where key stakeholders can participate and work toward consensus. There is no one best way  for communicating with stakeholders, and different methods will be appropriate in different steps of the  Workbook. Workbook steps have lists of resources that can help with external communications. Appendix  B also has cross-references to other guides that may be helpful.  Partnering with another organization in your area that has similar interests in assessing climate change  can be a great opportunity. When you go through your communication and consultation process (Step  1), you should ask if your stakeholders want to join together to assess climate change effects. If you decide to partner with another organization on a vulnerability assessment, Step 2Establishing  the Context for the Vulnerability Assessment provides an opportunity to identify common goals you  will jointly consider. If the other organization is already a key partner, it is likely that there is significant  overlapping interest and a common context can be established for this assessment.  During Step 3Risk Identification and Step 4Risk Analysis, working together to identify and  assess risks can save resources or time, and lead to a common outcome. There can be great benefits  to collaborating, and you certainly should when it makes sense. Partners might assess the same risk  differently simply because their organizations have different purposes. Always remember to keep your  organizations needs in mind.  In Step 6Establishing the Context for the Action Plan and Step 7Risk Evaluation: Deciding on  a Course, partnering opportunities are an important part of the process. Identifying who has mutual  interests and who can take the lead in mitigating particular risks will be a great way to accomplish more  than any organization can do by itself. In Step 9Preparing and Implementing an Action Plan and Step 10Monitoring and Review, let  your partners know how you are doing. You will want to hear about their progress too.", "50": "Process You should reach out to others who are interested  in what you are doing or who can help with your  adaptation planning. Communicate the purpose  of this work to decision-makers within your  organization and to key stakeholders. Everyone  should understand what you are trying to  accomplish and the expected outcomes.  Be able to describe what happens in each of the  steps before reaching out. What you tell and ask  other people will be much more useful if you  know how the rest of the process will unfold.  Some may be involved throughout the entire  process, while others may have a particular  interest in a single step or area of focus. However,  when Step 5 is completed, key people should  not be surprised to learn that you have a climate  change vulnerability assessment and that you  will be using that assessment to determine what  further actions are necessary.  Reaching out Every organization has a unique group of  stakeholders. Local governments, nonprofits,  federal agencies or watershed groups all have  different structures and different parties that  pay attention to what they do. Who is involved  in climate change adaptation planning is an  organizational decision. Leading candidates  would include:   anyone who would be part of  organizational strategic planning;  anyone who would help decide an annual work plan;  anyone who could help with the vulnerability assessment; and  anyone who might be able to help with implementing adaptation actions. Including the public in your planning can be helpful. The Additional Resources section in this step has  many resources about how the community can help, as well as strategies for engaging with them. Communication and consultation should occur throughout your planning, not just when it starts  and ends.

However, it will be possible to explain what you will be doing, how conclusions will be  reached, and what could be the next steps. Along with the organizational goals and objectives you are  considering for this assessment, key messages should include the following:   This vulnerability assessment is being launched because there is reason to believe that climate  change impacts will affect what your organization is trying to accomplish.  The purpose of the vulnerability assessment is to understand the risks that may occur, the  likelihood of occurrence for each risk, and the consequence if a risk should occur.  Risk management is part of decision-making. If climate changes are going to affect your  organizations ability to reach its goals, then you need to know what the impacts might be in  order to continue being effective.  Different perspectives on risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation are important, and  participation is welcome.  The outcome of the vulnerability assessment is an understanding of likely climate change risks;  any adaptation actions will be determined after that. Key questions for your consultations with stakeholders By nature, your stakeholders are invested and concerned with what you are doing. They can be a great  help as you develop and ultimately implement your adaptation plan. Let them know how you plan to use  their input. Your communication and consultation should strive to find answers to key questions about  how stakeholders can improve your vulnerability assessment or action plan:  Do they have resources, reports or data that they can contribute?  Do they know of any climate change work on stressors or impacts that exists or is ongoing?   Do they want to actively participate in the process or simply be informed of progress or updates?   Can they help with risk identification or risk analysis?  When it is time to decide on adaptation actions, would they be able to help implement actions to  reduce risks?   Do they have any no-gos that you should know about? Are there any topics that they are not  willing to discuss or consider?", "53": "oals are the fundamental elements Goals are the natural unit for seeing what problems climate  change may present and therefore they have important  roles in the vulnerability assessment. Goals describe what your organization intends to achieve,  and are therefore perfect for defining the scope of your  vulnerability assessment. Your vulnerability assessment  should include everything that affects your goals, while  omitting everything that has no effect on them. A useful  Sidebar elaboration defining strategic goals.  Goals Strategic goals should reflect the  broad, long-term, outcomes the agency  aspires to achieve by implementing its  mission. Strategic goals communicate  the agency efforts to address national  problems, needs, challenges, and  opportunities on behalf of the American  people. Both the way strategic goals  are framed and the substance they  communicate are important to consider.  Strategic goals should reflect the  statutory mission of the agency, and  most agency activity will align to the  strategic goals. Strategic goals need not  be as specific as strategic objectives,  however, and need not reflect every  activity that the agency must undertake  to accomplish its mission. OMB. 2013. Circular No. A11 (2013), Section  230Agency Strategic Planning. End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 21 Step 2 test that keeps your task from getting ever larger is to ask whether you would allocate resources for  efforts that have no effect on your goals. Your assessment should focus on the things your organization  cares about. You have already articulated your priorities when setting your goals. In addition, if there is no goal to test against climate stressors, then there will be no risks. The plain detail  that a stressor would cause something to occur in a place does not have meaning within itself. Once it  could affect a goal, an impact takes on a consequence. For example: you might identify that it could rain  tomorrowbut that would be just an incident; for many people that information would have no value.  However if you say it could rain tomorrow and we might not be able to have the picnic we planned, then  you introduce a consequence and you have a risk. A goal is the necessary piece for naming risks. There  will be climate change impacts all over your region but risks can only emerge if you cross climate change  stressors with your goals. Your organization may have goals that would be affected by climate change (e.g., controlling water  pollution or maintaining habitat) but may have others (e.g., recycling waste) that would not be affected  much at all. You will have to decide which of your organizations goals will be considered in this  vulnerability assessment. For a planning-level study like this, you should move forward with all of those  that could be affected by climate change.", "54": "Climate change stressors The Workbook uses seven types of climate change stressors to organize thinking:  Warmer summers (overall climate) This stressor is generally about the warm season being even warmer. This stressor (like warmer  winters, below) is about the general climate. Air, surface, soil and groundwater temperatures will  be warmer. The general climate effects of having warmer oceans or lakes are included here.  Warmer winters (overall climate) This stressor is about a cold season not being as cold as it formerly was.  Warmer water This stressor (regardless of season) comes from a higher temperature of water bodies (including  the ocean) and affects the chemical, physical or biological characteristics of the water body itself.  Increasing drought Drought is a deficiency in precipitation over an extended period. The magnitude of the  deficiency, the duration or the number of droughts could be greater.  Increasing storminess This category encompasses all aspects of intensifying precipitation in any form: more seasonal  precipitation, more total precipitation during events, higher rates of precipitation during events.  Stronger or more frequent instances of extratropical and tropical cyclones, blizzards or other  weather conditions are included here. If they are acting as stressors, then floods, waves, coastal  storm surge and wind are part of this storminess category.  Sea level rise This stressor is about the ocean being higher than it formerly was. It includes effects of higher  water levels right at the shore, as well as how elevated coastal water levels affect inland systems.  Ocean acidification  For the Workbook, this category is primarily conceptualized as related to ocean acidification via  atmospheric inputs of carbon dioxide", "55": "Risk paths Recall that a risk is the possibility that a given climate change stressor will affect your organizations  ability to meet its goals. Stressors and goals are embedded in the risk. You could be prevented from  reaching a goal because the environment changes in some way or because the projects you undertake  to reach your goal would fail in some way.  If there is any potential sequence (climate change stressor, and what follows) for an unwanted  consequence (not reaching your goal), then you have a risk. The risk develops along the path between  the cause and the effect. For example:  Stressor X could , and the result is that we might not attain Goal Y.   Warmer water (stressor) could lead to bacteria being more abundant in the river (path), and we  might not be able to provide healthy drinking water (unrealized goal).   More intense precipitation (stressor) could lead to flooding that knocks a sewage pump station  offline (path) and we might not be able to treat all the sewage that is discharged to the bay  (unrealized goal).  Sea level rise (stressor) will lead to more beach erosion (path) and we might not be able to  maintain the endangered bird species nesting sites (goal). Figure 3-1. The top diagram depicts an ideal business as usual scenario. At your place, your  organization undertakes various projects that help you to achieve your goals. In the bottom diagram a  climate change stressor is introduced to the business as usual situation (or to a no-action scenario). The  stressor could change the way the environment functions or change the effectiveness of the projects  that you would undertake, and potentially lead to unrealized goals. After the stressor is introduced, if  you can describe some chain of events that could happen that might keep you from realizing a goal,  then you have a risk.

Paths might involve contingencies or future human activity.  A diagram of a system can be very helpful for visualizing how climate change stressors could alter its  operations. It is not necessary to have climate change stressors in the diagram; the illustrations are just a  tool to help you think about where stressors could introduce unwanted effects. Diagrams can be simple  sketches of sequential events (Figure 3-2). If you can easily locate a conceptual diagram (Appendix D)  for a system comparable to yours, then a tool like that can be useful as well. Diagrams do not have to be  comprehensive or even exact representations of reality. They are simply tools to help you brainstorm and  identify risks. Most strategic initiatives are built on existing processes, and much of the organization is involved in the day-to-day work of delivering service to our customers. The Postal value chain is a series of closely linked processes, supported by a common infrastructure.  The overall quality and cost of the system depends not only on the actions of the Postal Service, but also on the actions of mailers and mail service providers. Value Chain U.S. Postal Service Figure 3-2. A visual depiction of the current system helps with identifying risks. Climate change  stressors like increasing storminess or hotter summers can be imagined to affect efficient mail delivery  in many ways. A diagram like this, from the USPS FY 2012 Annual Report to Congress, helps prompt  questions such as How would more wind and rain affect maintenance at post offices? Would hotter  conditions require more air conditioning? Does increasing temperature affect vehicle or aircraft  operations? Would more intense precipitation or more heat alert days affect mail delivery? You  might have come up with these risks even without an illustrationbut if you can have a diagram that  helps you think, then use it. What you need to do Every path that you can conceive is a risk to a goal and should be recorded in this risk identification step.  At this point, you need to rely on your expertise and knowledge about your system. In this step you want  to come up with as many of those possible pathways as you can.  Cross each climate change stressor with each of the goals you listed in Step 2. The intent is to  generate a list of the ways that each stressor could keep you from reaching the goal. This is much like  a brainstorming session. See Figure 3-3 for an example of how the process works for one goal and one  stressor.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 27 Step 3 Figure 3-3. An example of how to generate a list of what could happen in the space between  introduction of a stressor and failure to realize a goal. Record each risk (stressor, path and goal) in Table 3-3. If a potential risk is not identified in this step, it  will not move forward in the vulnerability assessment process, so write down everything. Step 4Risk  Analysis and Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks are where you analyze and evaluate the list of  risks you generate in this step. Dont dismiss risks! Even risks that you might think are insignificant should be captured in this step. Dont prematurely  dismiss anything. You may learn that a stakeholder thinks it is important, or in some instances further  analysis might show that a risk is not trivial at all. If you dismiss it now, it does not get considered later.  If it is in fact a trivial risk, the systematic process of risk management allows it to be assigned to such  a category in Step 4. Treat this step as a brainstorming session and document every risk you and your  team can identify. Risks are not inevitable A risk is not certain to happen, a risk could happen. You will analyze its likelihood in Step 4. Further, if  you decide that you want to change its likelihood, understanding the risk path could help you to find  ways to take action. You probably cannotby yourselfchange a stressor coming from global climate  change, and you probably dont want to change your goal, so if you do want to change the likelihood or  consequence of the risk you have to disrupt the path that transfers the risk from stressor to goal.  More than one problem from the same cause The same environmental stressor may intersect with several of your goals. You may find that you  seemingly identify the same risk many times. As an example, sea level rise may push saltwater farther up  rivers. This could have implications for drinking water sources, freshwater wetlands or shellfish habitat.

Help identifying risks This step has four tables (Tables 3-1a through 3-1d) that cross-reference the seven types of climate  change stressors with the purposes of clean water legislation to provide a starter list of more than 100  potential risks. If your organization has other types of goals, then add those goals to a table like Table  3-2 and identify the relevant climate change risks. More places to turn for risk references are listed in the  Additional Resources section. Opportunities (possibility of benefits) You might identify potential circumstances arising from any of the seven climate change stressors that  could be beneficial instead of harmful. These may reduce the severity of some other risk or just be  positive outcomes on their own. If it is the latter, an opportunity may free resources to address other  risks or even change the way your organization goes about business.

You will use Table 4-1 to characterize each  risk in five areas: (1) consequence, (2) likelihood, (3) spatial extent of the impact, (4) time horizon until the  problem begins, and (5) habitat type. This will become important information when your organization  determines its adaptation priorities.  Each risk needs to be assigned to the minimum number of people or teams (ideally just one) who can  provide a reliable initial analysis. You need an initial analysis of each risk along with some documentation  of the sources (which could be expert judgement). Try not to get stuck on determining the likelihood  or consequence of any one risk. Right now this will be an initial or a working determination. As more  information becomes available over time, or as others are able to assist, you can return to this step and  adjust the determination accordingly.  Whereas the Workbook methodology brings others into the process in Step 5, it could be desirable to  include others now if stakeholders indicated that they would help you with this part of your vulnerability  assessment. The involvement of more than one person can lead to differences in whether risks are rated  high, medium or low. The intent of this step is to provide one initial rating so that it can be refined via  wider consultation and participation in Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks. If you do receive  divergent input in this step, you need to come to a conclusion about which rating you will provisionally  adopt. Differences could be worked out here or postponed to Step 5. Figure 4-1. In this step, each risk from the list compiled in Step 3 is separately assigned to someone  (or to a team) who is qualified to come up with qualitative determinations of likelihood, consequence,  spatial extent, time horizon or habitat type. Others will be invited to review these determinations in  Step 5.", "58": "How precise do you need to be? This process requires a determination of the relative importance of each risk. You want to sort risks into a  fitting high-medium-low category: absolute precision is not needed.  Your aim in this step is to have risk determinations that are not wrong. Wrong would be saying high  and later changing a rating to low or vice versa. If the rating is believed to be correct, if you could  make a decent argument as to why you rated it that way and you do not expect to be changing it, if you  would be open to revision if compelling new information were provided, then that is sufficient precision  for this step. It is recommended that you use available information to rate a risk, as you will likely have many risks that  you have to work through and launching a bevy of new research studies will be impractical. Indicate how  the determination was made and what information or who was consulted, and move on to the next risk.  As new information surfaces and others are later able to provide additional information, you can revisit  the determination and adjust it if necessary.", "59": "Who should participate? How you choose to complete your initial risk analysis will be highly influenced by staff capabilities and  interests, as well as by the size, subject fields and availability of the expert pool you turn to. Three main  types of people should be invited to participate in this step: Your in-house staff: No one knows your program as well as the staff. If they have the ability to make a  first determination about the risks, then you should let the staff do as much as they can. Working on this  will also raise their knowledge about climate impacts. Experts: You probably already turn to specialists or professionals whenever you need to go beyond  your in-house knowledge or skills. Experts in climate, environmental sciences or natural resources from  government agencies, universities, NGOs or consulting companies who are familiar with your study  area could assist your staff with this climate change risk analysis. Experts could also be asked to do  the analysis themselves. Local experts (like the director of a public works department or professional  landscapers) can also contribute. They might in fact be the best people to estimate the consequence of  a risk. Partners: When you did your initial stakeholder consultation, people may have indicated that they had  expertise or knowledge in particular domains. It will be useful to bring those experts back into the  process now, especially if they said they could help with this step. For example, it may be useful to have  the president of the fishing club weigh in on the consequences of warmer water. You can approach different people about likelihood and consequence ratings for the same risk. For  example, you might ask climate experts about the likelihood of a risk and turn to in-house staff for a  determination of its consequences or its spatial extent.", "60": "Who should participate?

It is helpful to note the justification or source used to determine the likelihood and  consequence of each risk, as it will be a useful reference later on in the process (if you need to revisit this,  or to find out more when you are planning adaptation actions).  The Workbook uses scales with three divisions (high-medium-low). In order for this exercise to be most  useful, you must have a spread of likelihoods and consequences for the risks identified. If everything is  ranked as high-likelihood and high-consequence, the vulnerability assessment process is going to be less  effective as a decision-making tool. In the situation where a disproportionate number of risks are falling  into the high category, you should probably expand your definition of medium to capture more risks.  It may be helpful to define what each category (high-medium-low) means for your organization. Note that in the descriptions below for each parameter, the qualitative category (a) is always best and  (c) is the worst.  Consequence Consequence is the effect the risk would have on your organizations goal were it to occur.  (a) Low (life will go on; not as important as many other things; could adjust) (b) Medium (c) High (major disruption; goal is out of reach or not even attainable) Likelihood Likelihood is the chance of the risk actually occurring (i.e., probability). For the risk, you determine how  likely it is to affect the goal.  (a) Low (b) Medium (c) High For planning purposes you can avoid attaching quantitative probability labels to categories. Unless you  have access to a large team of top scientists and a lot of supercomputers for simulating the climate at the  scale of your study area and running the appropriate hydrological, hydraulic, demographic, land use, and  ecological models, your mathematical estimate of probability is not going to be any more accurate than  the qualitative category anyway.  Since this is a qualitative analysisto aid future decision-making by spreading the risks over three  categories, you could define your likelihoods so that 20%40% of your risks fall in each of the high- medium-low groupings (unless you have a large number of risks that are not likely to occur). All the risks  in the high category would be more likely to occur than those in the medium category, and likewise for  medium and low. Spatial extent Spatial extent refers to the proportion of your geographic area that the risk will affect (recall that the  Introduction states that this Workbook methodology works best at a spatial scale that is large enough  that risks are numerous and diverse and small enough that managers know the territory). Knowing  whether problems are isolated or widespread will help you in the action planning process as you decide  how best to use limited resources.  (a) Site (e.g., a few waterfront lots, a bridge, a sewage treatment plant) (b) Place or region (e.g., community, harbor, state park, wildlife refuge, sub-watershed) (c) Extensive (most of the watershed or most of the estuary) If a different spatial scale is more appropriate for your situation, then feel free to modify these  categories.  Sidebar elaboration on why qualitative scales are emphasized for use in this workbook.  Using a qualitative scale A qualitative scale at this stage is useful for several reasons:  Future changes in the climate system cannot be projected with the exactness that is needed to precisely  quantify the probability of a risk at any given future time.   You might need to contend with well over a hundred distinct risks. It would be prohibitively expensive  to scientifically quantify the likelihood of each one, as well as to estimate the cost of damages each risk  poses. The cost of doing the risk assessment should not exceed the cost of mitigating risks themselves.  The general public has a poor ability to process statistical probability. Research on decision theory  shows that giving people mathematically identical choices elicits different responses depending on how  a problem is framed.   It will be much easier to reach agreement on a qualitative rank (high-medium-low) than on whether  mathematical calculations of likelihood or consequence were done correctly. Some people might elect to use numbers to express a qualitative value (e.g., rank 15). Keep in mind  that these numbers are probably symbolizing subjective values because there is no easy mathematical  way to accurately derive one true quantitative value for each risk. If you are using numerals to represent  opinions, they are still categories. Unless going from category 1 to 2 truly represents the same  quantitative change as going from category 3 to 4, and respectively likewise for all the other numerical  relationships, you cannot properly add, multiply or divide with the numerals, or find their mean (although  median and mode are valid).  Be sure to look ahead to Step 5 and Steps 68b to understand how these categories will be used if you  are tempted to increase the number of categories or to do math with them. Is it really going to be helpful  to use 5-point scales or 10-point scales to generate 25 or 100 different classes of risk? Are you actually  going to use that level of differentiation to make decisions? The key thing here is not to overcomplicate the  process.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 40 Step 4 Time horizon Time horizon until the problem begins will help with developing your action plan. Decisions about low  or medium problems that will not emerge for decades could be postponed. Conversely, high-impact  problems that are already occurring need some attention right away.  (a) More than 30 years (b) 1030 years (c) Already occurring or 010 years Treat the time horizon for the risk as being independent of the likelihood of it occurring. If you think that  absolute dates are more appropriate than relative time periods, choose whatever works best for your  situation. Habitat type Habitat type is a category that is not necessarily a risk dimension. Identifying it now as you go through  your risk analysis and develop your table will become useful later when you work on an action plan in  Steps 610. When deciding on adaptation actions, you may want to group all of the risks associated  with a certain type of habitat. You might, for example, want to see all of the risks associated with tidal  wetlands or with residential areas. Looking across all the associated risks can help you choose adaptation  actions that address more than one risk.", "64": "How to proceed when climate projections give a range of answers Environmental managers have always had to deal with uncertainty when making decisions. It is important  to be transparent about the magnitude of the uncertainty, the range of possible outcomes, and the  resulting justification for making a specific decision. Nevertheless, sufficient information currently exists  to make good determinations about whether a risk is likely to lead to small or large problems. For the purposes of this analysis, knowing the direction  of the change is often enough. For example, you do not  need to determine whether sea level will be 1.25 feet, 1.5  feet or 1.75 feet higher 45 years from now. Instead, think  about what your system will be like when sea level is 1.25  feet, 1.5 feet or 1.75 feet higher in the coming decades.  Similarly, you probably do not need to determine whether  it is going to be 4F or 6F warmer. Think about what the  impacts will be at the low and high ends of your annual  temperature range when temperatures are consistently  warmer than they are now, or phenomena happen earlier  in the spring or later in the fall.  Sidebar elaboration on why the workbook methodology might not be suited for all problems.  Urgent problems Ultimately, if the scale or urgency of a  problem is so big that planning estimates  are not adequate, then you have to turn  to other risk management techniques  for those risks. The methodology of this  Workbook is not the right approach for  problems that need precise, quantified  answers. See Appendix C. End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 41 Step 4 As you are assessing your risks, it may be helpful to indicate the level of certainty associated with each  risk. When you evaluate the risks in Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks and later decide which  ones to move forward with in your action plan, you may find that there are some risks for which there is  great uncertainty and you need more information before investing resources to mitigate them.  When using the Workbook methodology to conduct a vulnerability assessment, use the best available  information and use an iterative process that allows you to reassess the identified risks as new  information arises.  How to proceed when climate projections give opposing answers As you move through your risk analysis, you may discover a situation in which climate projections indicate  different directions of change. For example, while examining the likelihood of more frequent drought  for your watershed, you might discover that some climate models show there will be more precipitation  events and less drought, while other models say that drought conditions will become more frequent. There are lots of climate models, and several standard scenarios that each could run. Because each  model is slightly different and the scenarios differ in their assumptions, every combination will have  a different result than every other simulation. Sometimes model results cluster in a narrow range;  sometimes that range is wider; sometimes the range includes both positive and negative projections of  change. How to proceed is related to how confident you would be about deciding on one direction of change  and its approximate magnitude. Your answers to the following questions about model outputs can  influence your decision:  Do you have an outlier model?  Do you have a continuous range of model results that happens to encompass zero?  Do you have two clusters of model results?  Do you have model results that are scattered all over the place? If your sense is that there is enough of a modeling consensus for you to move forward, then proceed.  But if your sense is that the best available climate change information is saying that anything could  happen, then in the process of gathering more information you have now identified a condition that  might lead to new risks. New risks come because your conclusion that climate could change in opposite ways has introduced a  new stressor. To continue the drought example, the increasing drought stressor would remain and you  would now have an opposite less-frequent drought stressor too. You might not think that less-frequent  drought is a stressor, but it is a change from current conditions and that could lead to some unwanted  changes in the environment. The potential for new risks might best be handled by returning to Step 3 Risk Identification and generating a new set of risks that would stem from the opposite stressor. Then  come back to this step with any newly identified risks. You will have to decide how to allocate likelihood  for the risks associated with the stressor pair. If you concluded that anything could happen then you  probably should not assign high likelihood to risks related to either half of the duo.", "65": "Thresholds or tipping points Tips occur when small actions, events or changes have large effects on future states. Environmental  systems that respond to climate changes by crossing thresholds will complicate your risk analysis. When BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 42 Step 4 an ecological threshold is reached, things that were changing gradually (if at all) suddenly change  abruptly. A low impact suddenly becomes high, or a local problem is suddenly everywhere, or a present/ absent switch occurs. Even if you do not know when a tipping point will be reached, you might be able  to anticipate that it will be reached. When sea level rise will push salty water upstream to a sensitive  freshwater marsh, or when the winter will become a frost-free season, cannot be known precisely.  However, anticipating these thresholds will better prepare you in the event that they do occur.  A risk could have a set of determinations about consequence/likelihood/area/timing that apply before  the threshold is reached and another for after. One strategy would be to split the risk into two risks: a  before-after pair. An alternative is to keep the risk intact and proceed with your risk analysis by answering  some questions:  Do you need to take action anyway? If this is a risk that will warrant attention even before a  threshold is reached, how you choose to respond may also affect the onset of the transition.  Mitigating a low risk now may head off the change to a high risk later.  Is the threshold reversible? If it is crossed, can you take actions that would undo the change, or  is it a one-way transition? Losing an endangered species is irreversible. Sometimes reversing the  change is theoretically possible but unrealistic. Try to stay in the plausible part of the spectrum.  How long will an effective response take? If you must respond to the risk if you do cross the  threshold, is the time to adequately respond short or long? If the consequences after crossing the threshold are high, and (because of permits, costs or other  foreseeable problems) it would take a long time to effectively respondwhether before or after a  tipping point is reachedthen this is a high risk, even if the time of onset is unknown.", "66": "Use existing information This application of the risk management process is intended to be completed with existing information  and resources.

To accomplish the objective of this step requires a little bit of finessing the chicken and egg dilemma. In  a systematic methodology, like the one this Workbook uses, when you have scores of risks and limited  resources, the dilemma is:   You can choose to mitigate each risk or use some other risk handling approach for each one.  Should you decide your approach before you even know whether there would be any suitable  mitigating actions you could take?  Investigating the options for mitigating a risk will take time and resources. You already know how  many risks are in your vulnerability assessment and that you might never be able to mitigate  each one; further there will be some that you know you never will act to mitigate. Should you still  expend the effort to investigate options for mitigating every risk so that you can make a logical  informed choice about whether to mitigate them? Basicallyshould you decide what to do and then investigate it further, or when you cant do everything  should you still investigate it all before deciding what to do? Trying to have one logical, systematic  process is what introduces the procedural difficulty. By definition, there is no easy way to resolve a  dilemma, but you will try to make it a smaller problem from two directions:  First you will get some familiarity with the mitigating actions that are circulating in the planning  world. Knowing that options might exist for your situation will help you to decide whether  mitigating any risk looks likely to succeed.   Second, because mitigation requires you to expend resources, you will try to screen out risks that  seem suitable for another approach. You want to filter the set of risks to decide where you will focus your resources. The idea is to head out  of this step with a reduced set of risks that you would prefer to mitigate and for which you might be able  to supply an appropriate mitigating action. Recording your high-level approach for each risk in Table 7-1  will set you up for Step 8aFinding Adaptation Actions and Step 8bSelecting Adaptation Actions,  where you will make finer deliberations about how and whether to proceed.

Right now you simply  want to increase your understanding of the types of actions that would be necessary to lower your risks. BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 57 Step 7 You want to get yourself to the point where you can say that it is realistic to think that a risk could be  lowered if you elected to work on it: then you can make a more informed decision about whether you  want to mitigate each risk or take a different approach. The Climate Ready Estuaries Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas, as well as other  documents (see the Additional Resources section of this step and Step 8a), will provide a sense for  what might work for your location and combination of risks. You might also recognize that some actions  address more than one risk.  While you will not be selecting actions in this step, having some familiarity  with ones your organization could take will be helpful. A fair amount of  work remains in Step 8a and Step 8b before you will select a specific  mitigation technique to use. Do not be too critical right now. In the same  way the Workbook advises not to dismiss risks while you are preparing  your vulnerability assessment, you should not dismiss actions here right  now. You will be tempted to bring in your organizations context or other  knowledge to eliminate possible actions. However, judgments about how  realistic something is will be coming back into this very soon.  For this part of Step 7, just understand what kind of mitigating actions are  in circulation and use your professional knowledge to simply think about  whether any would work to lower your risks if you (or someone else) could  implement them", "81": "Approaches for each risk Although these decisions will be made at a high level, you are deciding an approach for risks that  you determined have the potential to affect your organizations ability to meet its goals. You need to  be prudent as well as aware that how you choose to approach your risks will determine where your  adaptation actions are focused going forward. Your context and constraints will have a big influence on the approach you select. It will be helpful to  consult partners and stakeholders as you determine the approach for each risk. Some risks may be very  important to a stakeholder group, or work may already be underway to address other risks. It will also be  helpful to consider the spatial scale of the impact. You may opt for a different approach depending on  whether it affects a small or large area.  Risk management uses four general approaches for responding to any given risk:  Mitigate.  Transfer.  Accept.  Avoid. Mitigating a risk is the one approach in which your organization would be making changes to the risk  path (Step 3). The other approaches handle risk more administratively.", "82": "Mitigate Mitigating a risk involves taking actions to reduce the likelihood and/or consequence of the threat to  your goals. ", "83": "Transfer Transfer is a technical risk management term for having another organization take responsibility for  reducing the risk. Your risk is mitigated by another party. Buying an insurance policy is an example of  transferring risk by having another party reduce the consequences if the risk occurs. An environmental  management organization will probably not be buying insurance policies, but transfers can occur when  other organizations will act in ways to reduce your risks. Maybe your risk could be mitigated when a  highway is rebuilt or as part of other infrastructure work. Maybe you can agree to lead a reforestation  effort if a partner agrees to restore some other habitat. Maybe some agency has announced it will  be taking hazard mitigation actions that would have the co-benefit of reducing some of your risk. If  others actions are lowering the likelihood or consequence of your risks then you have transferred the  risk reduction responsibility to them. You arent mitigating the risk, but it is being reduced. Note that  you cannot unilaterally transfer a risk. Other organizations need to affirm that they will actually mitigate  the risk; otherwise the risk will still be there. You can opt to transfer some of a risk by partnering with  another organization or by making a financial contribution to someone elses mitigation project. If you  are working with partner organizations on your adaptation plan, this is an opportunity to decide which  organization is going to be the lead for which risks.", "84": "Accept You may have to consider accepting a risk if you are unable to mitigate or transfer it through a viable  strategy. Accepting a risk means that your organization will continue with business as usual and run the  risk, dealing with the impact if/when it does occur. You might choose to accept a risk for some time,  and then later begin to work on mitigating it. Reasons to accept a risk could include a long time horizon  before impacts are expected, inability to locate a suitable mitigation strategy, or a lack of worry about  the consequence of the risk. If more resources or information become available, you can re-evaluate and  decide if there is an opportunity to use another approach besides accept for a risk.  If you dont make a choice to use any other approach, then by default you have elected to accept a risk.  You are running the risk", "85": "Avoid The mitigate/transfer/accept approaches assume that you do not want to change your organizations  goals. If those three approaches are not feasible for you, then you may want to avoid a risk by narrowing  goals that are related to this risk. Avoiding is about being out of the risk altogether so it will not affect  you. Typically, avoiding a risk involves eliminating its root cause. However, since your organization by  itself will not stop climate change from occurring, and since you cannot relocate your place, avoiding  a risk in this context would require a shift in your organizations operations or goals so that you are no  longer exposed to that risk. For example, if one of your goals is to maintain some resource, but you  conclude that climate change is making that a lost cause, you could relinquish that goal. Avoiding a  risk does not mean the impact to the resource or to your place goes awaythis is an administrative  handling of risk in which you move away from this objective and you will no longer put resources toward  it. Avoiding a risk may be a radical move for an organization: you will be pulling back from work that you  thought was important. Reserve this approach for risks that will not be mitigated (by you or others) and  where accepting the risk is a bad proposition.", "86": "Avoid vs. accept The Workbook often states that if more information becomes available you should go back to earlier  steps. In the iterative process of risk management, choosing avoid for a risk appears to be something  new that has lots of other implications for your adaptation plan. If you are renouncing a goal, then all the  risks you identified in Step 3, which derive from that goal, would seem to vanish too. Thus those risks  would fall out of your matrix and vulnerability assessment. If they are not in your vulnerability assessment,  they would not make it into this step of action planning either. Logically, deciding to avoid a risk makes it  and everything related to it disappear. Instead of acting right away on this logic, you should let your choice of avoid sit for now. The  implications to your risks and goals arising from an iteration do not go away but are not an immediate  problem. Instead, you want to leave open the possibility that even more information could be coming.  The risk may turn out to be more benign than you thought; a new risk mitigation technology might  emerge; a new partner may agree to help you with the risk; windfall funding might come in; etc. If you  expunge the risk and the goal from your vulnerability assessment and action plan, you have nothing to  go back to if you do get more information. Keep the risk and the goal, and keep track of the fact that  you chose to avoid the risk. Things might change that would eventually let you select a mitigate/transfer/ accept approach.  Tracking a risk you choose to avoid keeps a goal on the books. You stop working on the goal itself but  do not drop it completely. Pragmatically, it really does not matter what your goal is or is not if you are  not going to put any resources into trying to reach it. The difference between the accept and avoid  approaches to a climate change risk thus become the difference between business as usual toward a  goal and no action toward a goal. Tabl", "87": "hoosing an approach for each risk Every risk that is on your matrixwhether in the high, medium or low categoryrepresents a potential  event that you determined could keep your organization from meeting its goals. In many cases you can  transfer all or some of the risk to a partner, you can simply accept and run a risk, or you can change your  goals so you avoid it altogether. If these are feasible or palatable then they are what you should do.  What you cannot transfer and do not want to accept or avoid, you must mitigate yourself. Mitigating a risk: Every risk that has a potential action that could lower it could be assigned to this  category. Actions that are easy, that you would do in pursuit of no-regrets or win-win solutions, or that  you simply think your organization should do, should be in this category. Accepting a risk: If you turn to your vulnerability assessment, you will find a time horizon determination  for each risk. All green risks in your C/P matrix (Step 5) are good candidates for an accept approach. The  farther out in time they seem to be, the better the accept approach gets. Yellow risks that are decades  away are also good candidates for the accept approach. Not accepting a risk: Risks with a high impact (red risks in your C/P matrix) are bad candidates for the  accept approach. You and your team identified these risks as highly likely to derail your organization. In  order to continue to function as an effective organization that can meet its goals, you should probably  choose another approach for these high-impact risks.  Risks you could accept but should assign for mitigation: These are the green risks that are happening  now as well as the yellow risks that are expected within the next 1030 years. The green risks are low- consequence problems anyway, and you have some time to respond to the yellow risks (unless the  response requires a very long lead time). Assigning them to the mitigation approach has the potential  advantage of keeping them moving through your adaptation planning steps.  If you assign these green or yellow risks to the accept approach, they will be out of sight and out of mind  as you create your action plan. The advantage of bringing them forward is that they will be in front of you  when you are trying to decide the mitigating actions you do need to pursue. Actions that might address BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 61 Step 7 higher risks could address these lower risks too. You might select some actions over others if you are  actively aware that they address lower risks too. Carrying these risks into the mitigation planning (Figure  7-2) may lead to better organizational choices about actions than if the risks are assigned to the accept  approach.", "88": "Further, if the climate changes faster than you expect or if you were too optimistic in your time horizon  determination, then by the time you complete another iteration of your vulnerability assessment, these  unwanted risks may already be upon you.  If you are not sure about mitigation: You are not obligated to start responding, but if you think you  would want to mitigate a risk in the future, then you could benefit from the risk management process  now by assigning it to the mitigation approach. In the systematic risk management process, only those  risks that you identify for mitigation will be carried forward to Step 8a and Step 8b, where you will select  adaptation actions for the risks, and to Step 9, where you will develop your plan. The other riskswhich  you are deciding not to actively mitigate but to transfer/accept/avoidwill be picked up in Step 10 Monitoring and Review after you write your plan.

Your organization is preparing a major strategy document. While this is not  a new strategic plan, it is a statement of how you plan to continue being able to achieve your mission  and goals.  If you selected the avoid approach for any of your risks, you need to carefully think through what this  means. You have chosen to withdraw from whatever goal would be thwarted by the risk. This may be  the whole goal if the goal is narrow (e.g., maintain critical habitat for a particular bird species), or it may  be a part of a goal if the goal is broad (e.g., maintain ecological diversity in your watershed). If you are  deciding to withdraw from pursuing a goal (and thereby in effect rewriting your strategic plan), key  decision-makers should approve this change in course.", "90": "To Get Started You need to mitigate everything that you cannot transfer and do not want to accept or avoid (Figure  7-3). Deciding which risks you want to mitigate may not be the best way to begin. For a first round of  decision-making it may be easier to leave the mitigation option for last, after you have rejected the other  strategies. To get started you should identify the risks that you can transfer to another willing party.  ", "91": "Finding mitigating actions that look promising As you find the points along a risk pathway where opportunities exist to mitigate the risk (Figure 8a-3),  you need to rely on your knowledge about your system to think about what actions might be promising.  You are looking for actions to apply at the relevant spots in the risk path in order to lower the likelihood  or consequence of a risk. Your professional knowledge and training may lead you in certain directions. As you were familiarizing  yourself with options in Step 7, additional ideas may have interested you. If your organization goals are  similar to the Clean Water Act goals, then Table 8a-1 of the Workbook presents the actions from CREs  Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas in a new format that you might find useful. If your  organization has goals specific to the management of water utilities, see resources from EPAs Climate  Ready Water Utilities program. For other sets of organizational goals, the Additional Resources section  at the end of this step points to sources of potential actions.  There are hundreds of potential actions that would alter a risk path and reduce the risks consequence/ probability. Many actions are trivial; some are practically impossible. You want to identify a plausible  range of actions in this step. This is probably not as open-ended a brainstorming exercise as it sounds,  but do not reject things that are novel. You want a range of actions because in Step 8b you may decide  that some are unpalatable for various reasons and should be rejected. Having a plausible range of  actions will help you find opportunities to use actions that might mitigate more than one risk, bring  co-benefits, or open up other opportunities. The best way to solve one particular risk might not be  as advantageous as a second-best way that mitigates other risks too. It is fine (probably desirable) to  identify the same action for more than one risk", "92": "Criteria to assess actions In addition to risk reduction potential, which you conditionally affirmed in the last step, the Workbook uses five other sets of questions (Americas Climate Choices Summary Report, p. 46) to apply to the pool  of potential actions.  Feasibility and effectiveness.  Cost and cost-effectiveness.  Ancillary costs and benefits.  Equity and fairness.  Robustness. Risk reduction potential  You already considered the risk reduction potential of  actions in Step 8a by affirming that you expect each  adaptation action (by itself or by a combination of actions)  to move a risk at least one box on your consequence/ probability matrix. Do you still believe that? Feasibility and effectiveness  Is the action a proven strategy? Are there other  places that have successfully implemented this  action?  Do you have enough time to implement it to prevent  risks from occurring?  Is it politically feasible?  Do you have, or can you get, authority or permission  to implement it?  Is it something your community/stakeholders would  accept? Cost and cost-effectiveness  Is it affordable? Which category does the cost of  the adaptation action fit?  Minor.

Managing for change Beyond managing for resilience,  the Nations capability to adapt will  ultimately depend on our ability to  be flexible in setting priorities and  managing for change. Prioritizing  actions and balancing competing  management objectives at all scales of  decision making is essential, especially in  the midst of shifting budgets and rapidly  changing ecosystems....Over time, our  ability to manage for resilience of  current systems in the face of climate  change will be limited as temperature  thresholds are exceeded, climate  impacts become severe and irreversible,  and socioeconomic costs of maintaining  existing ecosystem structures, functions,  and services become excessive. At this  point, it will be necessary to manage  for change, with a re-examination of  priorities and a shift to adaptation  options that incorporate information on  projected ecosystem changes.

Later in this step you will  consider how your available resources affect how many  actions you can implement and how much risk reduction  you can achieve. Ancillary costs and benefits  Is the action maladaptive?  Does action in one sector/place cause problems  in another sector/place?  Will action to reduce some risks encourage  people to take other risks they would have  avoided otherwise?  Does the action close off other options or lock  the future onto one path?  Co-benefitsdoes an action create positive side  effects that help with other non-climate problems or  with more than one climate change risk?

Are there adverse impacts on the environment,  ecosystem functions or ecosystem services? Equity and fairness  Does it align with your ethics and principles?  Does it cause a minority population or low-income  population to bear disproportionately high and  adverse effects?  Sidebar elaboration on the definition of sustainability and its three pillars.  Sustainability [S]ustainability and sustainable  mean to create and maintain conditions,  under which humans and nature can  exist in productive harmony, that permit  fulfilling the social, economic, and other  requirements of present and future  generations. Executive Order 13514 of October 5,  2009 The ultimate goal of adaptation is to  create a sustainable place (otherwise  adaptation actions are just patches and  short-term fixes). You want to create  places that will be resilient to the risks  that future climate changes will pose.  The National Research Council  recommends the Three Pillars  approach of Social, Environment, and  Economic dimensions of sustainability.  The intent is to create an integrated,  forward-thinking approach that takes all  of those elements into account. National Research Council. 2011.  Sustainability and the U.S. EPA.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 84 Step 8b  Are many asked to pay for benefits that accrue to just a few?  Does the action limit the adaptation options of other places or sectors? Robustness  Given inherent uncertainty about the future, will the action perform under a range of potential  conditions?  Is it a flexible adaptation action? Can it be modified at a future date if the climate changes  differently than expected?  Are you putting all your eggs in one basket, or is this action part of a coordinated set of actions?  Is it a no-regrets action? Is it just a good idea regardless of how climate might change?   Is it a win-win action? Would it also be a good strategy for achieving other desired social,  environmental or economic results?  Are there any circumstances where you would become sorry you implemented this action? These six tests can have many parts and the tests are not simple pass/fail questions. You are trying  to find actions that are desirable as well as effectiveand you want to avoid problematic actions.  These screening tests are really about deciding whether an action is unsuitable or appropriate for your  organization. Record your conclusions in Table 8b-1 and note whether you are willing to proceed with  each action.", "93": "Reviewing the screening assessment Not every action will pass all the tests. You truly do not want to implement actions that will not work,  that you cannot afford, or that cause other problems, but be alert for ways to compensate for those  problems. Which tests an action fails matter.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 85 Step 8b  If you disqualified an action because you cannot afford it, you might be able to transfer that risk  to others who can pay the costs. Alternatively you may need to focus attention on finding the  funds.  If the impediments are political or structural, then your first acts toward reducing a risk may be to  find ways to overcome those obstacles.  If an action generates unwanted effects, then those tradeoffs might be mitigated too. You may not be able to find any actions for some risks.  If you cannot find a single mitigating action for a risk that passes your screening tests and that you  want to implement, then a potential partner probably will not find one either, so transferring this  risk may not work. You probably need to accept or avoid the risk.   Keep track of actions that failed one or more of the screening tests because conditions may  change over time and these actions may become more attractive in the future. The best actions will pass each screening question. Actions that do satisfactorily on your tests will move  forward for further consideration of their risk reduction potential in the rest of this step.  Risk-based ranking of actions This Workbook assumes (as expressed in the Introduction) that users will have to prioritize response  actions because not all can be implemented. The mitigating actions that pass the six criteria will address  a variety of risks that will affect different goals, that will occur in different habitat types, and that range  from high-impact risks (red in your matrix) to low-impact risks (green).  In a risk management process, the best actions will be the ones that achieve the most risk reduction.  Your task now is to sort all of your screened actions according to how much of your climate change risk  they will mitigate. For each action, you first need to return to the C/P matrix and see whether the primary target of the  action is a red, yellow or green risk. Do a rough sort of your list so that actions that respond to red risks  are at the top, and actions that respond only to green risks are at the bottom (Figure 8b-2, left). What follows is a set of decision-making guidelines that will help you refine the rough sorting. Some  actions are more attractive because they respond to your organizations total risk better than others, and  they should float higher on your list. Note that a group of actions can be assessed as one coordinated  set. Your C/P matrix and the information you developed about the action in Step 8a will help you to  construct the ranking.  Actions that address red risks  Responding to red risks should be at the top of the list. You said these risks are highly likely to  happen and will have high impacts when they do. Actions that would mitigate a red risk should  get priority over responses to a yellow risk.  Actions that reduce more than one risk are more attractive than comparable ones that reduce  only one risk. Be sure the main target risk is making real movement to the lower left of your  matrix. Do not do a little bit for a red risk just because it also does a little for a yellow risk: focus  on meaningfully reducing risk.  Actions that would move red risks closer to the lower left corner of your matrix are more attractive  than comparable actions that would leave them further away. But do not spend a fortune to  mitigate risks down to zero if getting them into the green zone is sufficient.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 86 Step 8b  Do not duplicate efforts unless you intend to. You should not expend resources to implement  more than one solitary action to achieve the same risk reduction, but if an action is part of  a coordinated set of risk reducing actions, that is fine. If an action is part of a planned set of  redundant actions, that is fine too. Actions that address yellow risks  Yellow risks should not be the primary target of your efforts unless you have no red risks. Look for  opportunities to move yellow risks into the green zone as part of your work on other red risks.  You may have an opportunity to take an action that would reduce a few yellow risks instead  of taking another action that would reduce one red risk. This is a judgment call based on the  magnitude of all the contextual benefits each choice could achieve. However, do not work to  clean out the yellow zone while leaving red risks intact. Actions that only address green risks  Actions that respond only to green risks should be at the bottom of your list. You have decided  these risks are less likely to occur and would not matter as much if they did. You probably should  not dedicate any resources to them that would take away from responding to yellow or red risks.   Actions that have negligible costs (in time and money) and can be taken as a part of other normal  business are more attractive than other actions aimed at green risks.  Instead of launching a project aimed at a green risk, look for opportunities to fine-tune an  action you will use to address a red or yellow risk. Maybe those actions can incorporate a small  component that further reduces green risks. After you assess your pool of actions, you should have a relative ranking (like the example on the right  side of Figure 8b-1) of the whole set of actions based on how much of your organizations overall risk they  reduce. This is a risk-based ordering of actions.  Selecting actions for implementation You are setting out to reduce the overall climate change  risk to your organization. A risk-based ordering of actions  means that each action (or coordinated set of actions)  reduces more risk than the item below it on the list. If  you moved actions to be out of sequence on the list  (either further up or further down), then some actions that  reduce less risk would appear higher on your list than  actions that reduce more risk. If you need to prioritize response actions because you will  not be able to implement them all, the next thing is to  divide your actions into two tiers. Tier 1 actions are the  ones your organization has the capacity to start on within  your workplan cycle. Tier 2 is the waiting list. Taking into  account your organizations financial and human  resources, you should draw a line separating the actions into Tier 1 and Tier 2 as far down from the top  of the list as you can in order to maximize the number of actions in Tier 1 (Figure 8b-2). If Tier 1 reaches down to an action that you cannot afford but you can afford more actions below that  particularly expensive one, then: (1) note that one action is too costly and that you are skipping it in this", "94": "work planning cyclebut dont change its place in the ordered listand (2) move the line down so that  as many actions as you can afford are in Tier 1. The actions in Tier 1 generate the most risk reduction you can realize at this time. Tier 1 actions will move  into Step 9 for implementation. The actions that are beyond your current capacity will be in Tier 2 and  will not move forward right now. Actions that you skip are technically in Tier 2, but keep their place in the  ordered list.", "95": "Concept approval In Step 7, you may have worked with your partners to negotiate a transfer of certain risks. You may also  have decided to run some risks by choosing to accept them. You may have decided to avoid some risks.  You decided to try to mitigate the remaining risks. You also confirmed with your key decision-makers that  they concur with the high-level approach for each risk. In Step 8b, you selected promising adaptation  actions for all the risks you intend to mitigate, and you are proposing to move that set forward for project  design and implementation. Before you go further with your action plan, this is another opportunity to  run it by your organization board of directors, management committee, staff, and the people who are  regularly involved in decisions for their concurrence about how you propose to manage your risks. A planning-level plan In this last planning-level step, you will create the  mechanisms to ensure that you make progress. You want  to create two risk management tracking systems. One  tracks the actions; the other tracks the risks. You will create  two tables that start as inverses of each other. Each table  should be updated regularly. The first table (Table 9-1) tracks the actions and notes  which risks they are associated with as well as who has  responsibility for implementing them. An action may  address more than one risk. The second table (Table 9-2) keeps track of your risks and  notes what actions are being used and when they are  completed. A risk may be affected by more than one  action.

As time passes, your context may change, so your plan  will need to be adjusted to suit these changes. Your  organization may take on new challenges and have new  goals. Your budget or personnel may change. Perhaps the  political situation in which you operate evolves. Or maybe  you identify more partners to transfer risks tofreeing up  more resources and time for you to address other risks.

Climate change: New climate change science will likely emerge after you have completed your  adaptation plan. Information about magnitude of projected changes and new knowledge about  expected impacts will continue to be improved. Incorporate new information (e.g., science, data) as it  becomes available so that your plan stays current and effectively addresses your risks.

The framework can be adapted by  communities anywhere in the country for their context and can be modified to cover small or  large geographic areas and their economies.

After identifying the assets, the  team determines each assets vulnerability by looking at the assets exposure to the threat, the  effect on operations, and the ability to adapt or protect itself. The team also summarizes potential  positive and negative impacts on the economy if the asset is affected by a climate hazard.  In step 4, the assessment team uses the information in the table to analyze the overall economic  implications for the community. In this step, the team develops a comprehensive picture of local  economic risks and opportunities associated with climate change.  Finally, in step 5, the team explores options to enhance resilience and pursue economic  opportunities that could come with climate change.

A resilient community will continue to thrive in the  face of those stressors.  A resilient community will also find ways to adapt its economy to opportunities that arise from  the changing climate. Opportunities could come from changing consumer preferences,  consumption patterns, demands for new products and services (including those that are climate  resilient), major public infrastructure engineering and construction, and alternative supply chain  services.  Businesses that can operate with minimal interruption during and after extreme weather events  could have a competitive advantage over less-prepared companies.

In this step, the team will:  2.1. Select climate change scenarios.  2.2. Assess hazards.  2.3. Select a method for spatial analysis.  The assessment team can choose to use a basic, moderate, or more advanced approach for this  step, depending on available resources (Figure 8). The factors include the teams level of  technical expertise in impact assessment (e.g., climate change, hazard, and spatial analysis),  available resources (e.g., computer equipment, funding, and time), and the type of hazard maps  that are available.", "152": "Climate change scenarios show how the world might look in the future depending on how global  greenhouse gas emissions increase or decrease. If the community has already conducted a  climate vulnerability assessment, the team can select projections from that analysis to use for  economic assessment. Community economic development leaders are often interested in longer  range projections to have time to plan for anticipated trends, while individual businesses might  want to look 15 or 30 years into the future, depending on their product or service and lease or  ownership status. The team can consider the objectives and resources that it established in step 1  and select the most appropriate scenarios.  If the community does not have a completed climate vulnerability assessment or other related  studies from which to draw, the team will need to determine what it will use based on how it  intends to obtain climate impact information and what is available.  For the basic approach, communities with no climate change projections for their geographic  area can use regional scenarios developed for the National Climate Assessment and tools from  federal agencies and nongovernmental groups to get a general sense of impacts likely to occur in  their region (see appendix C for links to resources). Some states have more regionally specific  climate change projections, and some regions have also developed finer-grained projections. For  the moderate or advanced approach, the team can work with climate change specialists to  develop finer-grained projections for the community. Many universities have climate change  specialists who could help conduct more in-depth analyses of local climate change projections.  To ensure it can explain and defend the assumptions underlying the assessment, the team should  document the climate change scenarios it selected and why (e.g., data availability or relationship  to the community goals and objectives). The team should keep in mind, however, that just as  communities use demographic, economic, and other estimates and projections in planning and  decision-making, it can use a plausible future scenario such as those described in the National  Climate Assessment as a reasonable basis for the assessment. It does not need to narrow down  projections to precise numbers, simply to a plausible range for future conditions.

The following examples  are based on projected hazards for the northeastern United States, but other hazards such as  wildfires can be included where appropriate:  Sea level rise: For coastal communities affected by sea level rise, the team can  generate a map of the area expected to be inundated at high tide under the  selected climate change scenarios. The team can summarize the projections of  the depth of the water and the geographic boundary of the inundation area from  the various tools or studies it uses for the selected scenarios. Flood and storm surge: The team can determine the boundaries of the areas  where water is expected to temporarily inundate land to a specific, problematic  depth during or immediately after a storm. Extreme heat and drought: In most cases, the spatial gradient for temperature  and drought conditions will be very low or unnoticeable at the local scale.  Unless assessment tool results suggest otherwise, the team can assume that the  entire community will have approximately the same changes in the number of  extreme heat days or drought frequency under the selected climate scenarios.", "155": "The basic approach gives the team a general sense of the impacts the community might  experience using online tools and hard-copy maps. Although a community might use this  approach as a starting point to raise awareness of potential impacts and vulnerabilities, the basic  approach is not sufficient for developing land use regulations or making infrastructure siting or  other engineering decisions. For team planning purposes, analysis of each climate-induced  hazard (e.g., storm, flood, drought) for a community the size of North Kingstown could take  approximately eight to 24 hours. The team can approximate affected areas and identify the assets  to create a general consequence assessment that estimates what would be affected and how that  might affect the community. The moderate approach gives the team a better sense of the location and magnitude of potential  impacts. The team would use digital data and GIS tools for this approach. This analysis might  take more time and resources, depending on the availability of GIS data, but it can provide a  more accurate depiction of the assets exposed to climate-related hazards and help the community  identify appropriate adaptation strategies. For a community the size of North Kingstown,  analysis of each climate-induced hazard could take from four to 80 hours, depending on the level", "156": "of data available and analysis required.

This approach gives the community a  better sense of the magnitude of potential impacts  and could help justify any adaptation strategies the  community eventually chooses. However, it  requires Hazus modeling expertise and sufficient  resources to conduct the more detailed analysis.  Hazus is a free, nationally applicable standardized  methodology that contains models for estimating  potential losses from earthquakes, floods, and  hurricanes.5 Hazus uses GIS technology to  estimate physical, economic, and social impacts of  disasters and graphically illustrates the boundaries  of locations at high risk.

Whether a utility is publicly or privately owned will not necessarily affect its risk, but its ownership is important for the team to know when discussing potential actions to improve resilience. When filling out the assessment form, consult with local utilities if they do not have representatives on the assessment team.

Drought can reduce water supplies while economic growth might be increasing demand.   Green spaces, including wetlands, salt marshes, flood plains, meadows, and woods, naturally filter and store rainfall. Trees provide shade, reduce ambient air temperatures, sequester carbon dioxide, and increase property values and commercial activity.   Climate change puts city tree canopies and local forests used for production at more risk from fire, drought, and pest infestation.

It is not necessary to spend a great deal of time refining  this scale. The important thing is to have a consistent basis for distinguishing where climate- related hazards pose the greatest risk to the local economy. The sample assessment form uses high, moderate, low, and none as a scale to help  estimate and compare assets vulnerability to various climate impacts. The team could establish  ranges for each level; for example, a low level of risk might be that 1 to 5 percent of the asset  category could be affected by the climate hazard, a moderate level could be 5 to 20 percent, and  a high level could be more than 20 percent. To bracket the ranges, the team could consider  factors such as value of the assets, potential for collateral impact (i.e., dependence of other  economic activities on those assets), or similar concerns. Ultimately, the team can use whatever  scale it wants based on the communitys context and threats.  Once the team has defined a scale, it can apply it to each identified asset for each climate  change-related hazard. Some hazards (e.g., sea level rise, flood, and storm surge) affect only  specific areas of the community, while others such as drought and extreme heat might affect the  entire community.

Set Guiding Principles and Motivations  By determining guiding principles and motivations, the community can  establish its compass for navigating through the remaining components  of the planning process. The guiding principles and motivations are one  of the plans most interactive sub-components and should assist deci- sion-making activities in the subsequent components (i.e., Vulnerability  Assessment, Adaptation Strategies, and Implementation Strategies). The communitys guiding principles and motivations for sea level rise  adaptation planning should be set by the plan development team and  the steering committee. The principles and motivations examine how  the community operates and set its vision for the future which leads  to planning goals. Convening a group to set the overarching goals is  one primary method for identifying and organizing guiding forces into  a single planning process. The principles may align well with goals, and  motivations can be aligned as objectives to meet one or more goals.  Setting goals is also a part of the comprehensive planning process and  Local Mitigation Strategy process (see 44 CFR 201.6 (c)(3)(i)), which are  both recognized at the state and federal level as an important step in  facilitating hazard planning efforts. Communities should ensure that  the goals of their adaptation plan fit well within the goals set by other  planning mechanisms such as their Local Mitigation Strategy, Post-Di- saster Redevelopment Plan, Comprehensive Plan, Historic Preserva- tion Plan, and others if applicable. If the goals from different plans  conflict, then the implementation phase will likely be difficult and may  reach an impasse.", "246": "1.3. Describe the Geographic Context Describing the geographic context delineates the boundaries of the plan- ning area and the assets, buildings, and structures contained therein.  It is important for the planning team to contextualize the physical loca- tion for which a community is planning. Describing the geographic con- text should include maps with the location of the community within  the larger region as well as topographical, hydrological, and zoning  layers that indicate current limitations and opportunities for develop- ment activities. The maps and information developed in this plan sub-component  should support the activities within the Vulnerability Assessment com- ponent.

Public Outreach Approach Public participation is important for identifying social, cultural, eco- nomic, and physical factors, which need to be considered during the  establishment of guiding principles used to develop community adap- tation strategies. It is also the appropriate avenue for socializing the  plan. When local ideas, concerns, and preferences are considered,  adaptation strategies can be tailored to meet community needs and  desires. Plans and policy that are developed with broad stakeholder  participation are more likely to be well-received and gain public support  when residents have participated in the process from the start. While  some members of the public may not welcome the process initially,  walking them through the various components generally helps estab- lish valid and urgent reasons why sea level rise adaptation is needed.", "261": "General Public Often, members of the public have had experiences in the past that  can significantly contribute to discussions of vulnerabilities and adap- tation possibilities. The wealth of knowledge in the local community  should not be discounted, and every effort should be made to gather  it and use it. The first step is education and awareness, allowing individuals to truly  understand the threats of sea level rise and flooding based on the  effects of total water level. Efforts to educate local stakeholders on  current and future flood hazards can be enhanced by directly engag- ing the public using nontraditional outreach techniques, such as social  media and interviews. Looking ahead, todays youth will be the ones inheriting the full brunt  of sea level rise, greater storm surge events, and extreme precipitation  that leads to devastating floods. Future generations will continue the  task of addressing these climate issues, and some individuals will likely  embrace involvement. Youth can help contribute their skill with things  like social media to enhance the outreach effort. They also can bring  energy, a fresh perspective, dedication to shaping their future, and  willingness to think outside the box to help find innovative ideas and  concepts to advance adaptation planning.", "262": "Community conversations to identify goals should be centered on topics  including:   Background information and critical risks.   The steps that can be taken to reduce risks.   Why adaptation planning efforts are important for the community.   How the proposed strategies will impact the community.   Which proposed strategies the community prefers.   Steps residents can take to assist in community adaptation efforts. In doing so, an informed set of stakeholders may be equipped to add great  value to the critical thinking behind Focus Area prioritization (see Chapter 2.3).", "263": "Outreach Strategies The success of adaptation strategies largely depends upon confidence  in the idea that reductions in long-term risk exposure, combined with  present day mitigation efforts, will be sustained. Outreach is an import- ant activity that can help build this confidence and lead to future action;  however, each communitys outreach strategy will be unique to reflect  local conditions. To ensure that adaptation is well received in the com- munity, simply posting information on the citys website is a first step  although it will not be adequate on its own. Positive public informa- tion efforts that outline what people can do are more likely to impact  behavior. It is not enough that people know they are in a hazardous  area; they need to want to do something about it. Community mem- bers must understand the effects each strategy will have on them and  what actions they can take. Therefore, messaging is very important.  ", "264": "A key public engagement approach is to shift from telling towards  asking about what should be done. Residents are deeply connected  to where they live, and crowdsourcing information can add a new layer  to components like the Vulnerability Assessment (e.g., allow citizens to  tell their personal experiences of how their homes, streets, or the busi- nesses they frequent have been impacted by king tides and pinpoint  these locations on a map with a tag describing the impact).", "265": "It is important to prepare for outreach  and create specific content areas. A com- munity with a proactive outreach strategy  that speaks to specific community social  and political views will have a greater  chance of moving beyond informing to  prompting community members to act.  Determining the different stakeholder  views will lend itself to a more tailored  and appropriate outreach strategy, a chal- lenging task. As part of an early outreach  strategy, it is recommended to incorporate  a chart of the recorded sea levels for the  nearest NOAA tide gauge over the last 50  to 75 years to represent the historic sea  level rise trend. This action should help  establish evidence-based reasons for  approaching adaptation, help get beyond  personal opinions, and start a process of  deeper community conversations about  what to do about sea level rise.", "266": "The following table details a spectrum of stakeholder participation methods, ranging from in-person to internet communication. The planning team is  encouraged to evaluate which method may work best at each of the six public participation points of the adaptation planning process. Method Description Advisory group/task  force Small group of people representing various interests set up to give advice on programs or actions. In this planning process, an  advisory group of more technically oriented individuals may be appropriate for something like Exposure Analysis. App A program that operates on a smartphone. Could be used to poll, disseminate information, or provide services. Charrette Intense, single or even multi-day effort to design something or solve a problem. Field trip Trip to specific location organized so that participants can match mental images to real conditions. Focus group Small discussion group led by a facilitator who draws out in-depth stakeholder input on specific questions. Hotline Widely advertised telephone number that directs callers to someone who can answer questions and collect input. Interview Face-to-face or telephone interaction with stakeholders conducted by the agency or by a third-party representative. Large group/small  group meeting Opening presentation then division into smaller groups to discuss an issue or complete a task. Open house  Event in which the public is invited to visit a location with staffed booths or stations. These stations could include areas with  maps (either paper maps or computer stations) facilitated by the meeting organizers staffed with various subject matters  experts. Poll or Survey Written or oral lists of questions to solicit community impressions/facts about issues at a specific moment in time. Public hearing Formal, single meeting where stakeholders present official statements and positions that are recorded. Public meeting Large public comment meeting where comments are made to entire audience. Referendum A direct vote by the whole electorate on its support of specific proposals. Retreat Concentrated, informal meeting that emphasizes social interaction as well as issue discussion. Social media Information and interactive event and issue marketing carried out through web and app platforms such as Facebook, Twitter,  and Instagram. Story map An interactive, web-based map that provides enhanced information about locations. Town hall meeting Less formal public hearing where stakeholders have the opportunity to speak and/or vote. Website An online resource center that may provide (on the front end) information, interactive data, feedback mechanisms, and (on the  back end) analytics to administrators. Workshop Small stakeholder gathering, typically fewer than 25 people, designed to complete a specific assignment in a short time period.

Best Practices in Stakeholder Involvement Best practices in stakeholder involvement and participation are deter- mined by the principles established at the beginning of the planning  process and are the preferred end result of the chosen strategy.  Depending on the type of audience and engagement, the best possible  techniques for stakeholder involvement will vary. All of the best prac- tice strategies may not be applicable for each stage in the adaptation  planning process, but all are factors that can shape how community  involvement may be designed. However, key best practices typically  include all of the elements below:   Opportunity for input   Motivated participants   Influence over the final decision   Best available information exchange   Constructive dialogue   Adequate analysis   Transparency   Representative participation   Cost-effectiveness   Accessibility   Limited influence of sponsor   Positive social conditions   Social learning Specifications for each best practice element are matched with the  medium of communication and the stakeholders that are involved.

This is a step-by-step methodology presented in a logical  sequence that will help lead a community to priority actions and pri- ority areas. The Exposure Analysis visually represents the potential  encroachment of the sea into land areas, and the Sensitivity Analysis illustrates the variety of entities that may be affected by a rise. Each  community may adapt the Exposure and Sensitivity Analyses to suit  their own priorities. With these analyses in hand, the community can  turn its decision making toward assigning Focus Areas. Focus Areas constitute the selected locations where the Adaptation Strategies  component will direct its attention.", "270": "To ultimately write an adaptation plan that reflects the expertise and  interests of the communitys local stakeholders, public involvement  should be included at each step. Community members need to know  about the potential threat of coastal flooding, and they need to know  concrete information about the planning being done to confront it.  Early introduction of sea level rise visualization tools can indicate the  great level of detail that scientists have already committed to project- ing and mapping future change and can be very tangibly felt when  shown in a specific community. Integrating testimonials of those who  have perceived experience with sea level rise can contribute to the  authenticity and local focus of the process.

The Exposure Analysis process may be defined in four steps.  First, a sea level rise model is chosen. Secondly, horizon dates (e.g.,  2040, 2070) are selected to guide the models first output. Then the  model calculates static sea level rise elevations (and can also predict  other changes to local coastal landscapes) for how much sea level  rise is probable at the chosen horizon time points. Finally, future inun- dation areas are located (typically within a GIS map window). The out- put of this step is important because it generates a listing or mapping  of the coastal areas that are likely to be impacted. The Exposure Anal- ysis includes assumptions regarding the manner in which the eustatic  (the total volume of ocean water) and vertical changes in sea levels  could affect a community.Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 31 30 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook The Statewide Vulnerability Assessment Report (2014)10 recommends  utilizing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change  Curve Calculator coupled with static point projection of inundation.

For such an analysis, additional GIS data  layers are needed to assess where the projected inundation is likely to  affect structures, populations, conservation areas, and other entities. The Statewide Vulnerability Assessment Report (2014)11 recommends  pairing or overlaying the Exposure Analysis model outputs (i.e., GIS  data layer of coastal inundation) with all entities identified in the table  below to determine which entities are sensitive to sea level rise.

Public Outreach Approach,  Communicating Risk, and Opportunities for  Community Participation Assigning the Focus Areas is an opportunity to conduct public outreach  and seek community participation in the Vulnerability Assessment  component as discussed in Chapter 2.3. The Vulnerability Analysis  public outreach, including sharing the results of the Exposure and Sen- sitivity Analyses, is an excellent forum to inform the public and stake- holders about the future risk of sea level rise and potential increased  flooding. It also provides a basis for the next round of meetings which  includes identifying mitigation strategies to address the vulnerability  (see Chapter 3).  The public should be given the chance to provide input about what  should become Focus Areas for the community. Information about  the potential encroachment of the sea into land areas and the entities  affected by a rise should be conveyed to the public during a workshop  or public meeting. Based on the feedback received from the public,  preferential areas can be determined that may be deemed Focus  Areas. The completion of this round of public outreach sets the stage  of who will be affected and to what degree to set up the adaptation  strategies.", "292": "3.1.

Prioritize Adaptation Needs Once the adaptive capacities of the local community have been identi- fied, a prioritization framework can follow. At this point in the planning  process, the community should be aware of the impacts of potential  sea level rise and inland flooding, have identified its focus areas to  address the impacts, and/or have inventoried the capacity of the com- munity to adapt. It is at this step that the community combines those  findings and creates a short list of its biggest challenges to determine  what can feasibly be done where and when.16 Articulating a communitys biggest challenges to sea level rise is a nec- essary step in identifying adaptation needs. For example: The most  important challenge facing the local agency is adequately address- ing the current state of the wastewater treatment plant which is at  increased risk to flooding or Elevating the many bridges in the local  agencys jurisdiction to withstand 2 feet of sea level rise is our high- est priority. Prioritizing adaptation needs sets the stage for the next  sub-component  creating specific adaptation strategies. Prioritization can be as simple as selecting the needs that can be  addressed currently (using capacities already identified as robust in the  Assess Adaptive Capacity step or categorized as low-hanging fruit)  and saving the more involved solutions for later. Conversely, it may  be more important for a local agency to tackle large-scale expected  impacts first, regardless of cost and complication, due to urgency", "295": "3.3. Identify Adaptation Strategies  Once major needs and priorities are defined, specific adaptation strat- egies can be developed, vetted, and defined. It is very important to  note that many options are available when an area is projected to be  flooded, either permanently or intermittently. A community can select  from a wide range of adaptation strategies in the following categories:  Protection, Accommodation, Retreat, and Avoidance. ", "296": "Protection strategies involve both hard and soft (or gray and  green) structurally defensive measures to mitigate impacts of rising  seas while leaving the vulnerable structures behind these measures  largely unaltered. Seawalls, revetments, and levees are examples of  hard or gray protection strategies, while beach nourishment, oyster  reef restoration, and living shorelines are all examples of green protec- tion strategies.", "297": "Accommodation strategies alter physical design to allow the structure  or land use to stay in place. Examples of this are floodable develop- ment, floating structures, and increased stormwater storage via imple- mentation of Low Impact Development or Green infrastructure (LID/ GI) in upstream locations. LID/GI upstream improvements reduce  downstream flows by allowing more stormwater to infiltrate in place,  thereby taking the pressure off the existing downstream stormwater  infrastructure. In the Netherlands, a concept known as Room for the  River helps dictate land use compatible with periodic flooding being  designated adjacent to all major Dutch rivers.  ", "298": "Retreat from areas or infrastructure where protection or accommoda- tion will not be efficient or effective can be voluntary, incentivized, or  done gradually. It can also involve new building designs in vulnerable  areas to be altered or moved when appropriate in the future. Com- munities can also plan for an eventual retreat from barrier islands and  coastal high hazard areas but, in the meantime, continue to invest  in assets in a limited fashion based on that assets expected lifetime  and projected inundation. It is important to note that communication  about retreat can be difficult. The language used to convey adaptation  strategies can make a difference in how communities react to propos- als. The term retreat often conveys a defeat, which can deter stake- holders from embracing the strategy. They may instead fight it. Other  possible terms to use include managed relocation and realign- ment. Home buyout programs, rolling easements, and land swaps are  a few possible mechanisms that communities can investigate in order  to implement managed retreat. There is also a growing body of case  law in this arena.", "299": "Avoidance involves guiding new development away from areas that  are subject to coastal hazards and can be done by implementing pol- icy and/or offering of incentives. Since capital infrastructure is devel- oped and maintained for a relatively long lifespan, planning for future  changes in sea level should be a part of initial design or incorporated  when plans are due for periodic update. City and County Land Devel- opment Regulations and Codes, as well as zoning regulations, can be  used to direct development and redevelopment to more suitable areas  where flooding and erosion are less troublesome. See Chapter 3.6 for  information about Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), another  strategy for avoidance.", "300": "Adaptation Action Areas  a State Planning Tool The designation of Adaptation  Action Areas (AAAs) is a compre- hensive planning tool that has been  available since 2011 with the pas- sage of the Community Planning  Act by the Florida legislature. An  optional but highly recommended  tool for adaptation strategies, AAAs  lend themselves to a flexible form  of zoning overlay that delineates  the physical areas where certain measures, restrictions, or prioritized  funding would apply. It is especially beneficial to designate AAAs now  because local agencies currently have the option to devise criteria  for their designation and the flexibility to edit them as circumstances  change. In many instances the 2018 FIRM update expands FEMA-des- ignated floodplains, however, in places where they are being reduced,  the need for AAAs is especially urgent. These areas are still vulnerable  to flooding, but property owners who have the option to drop flood  insurance will likely do so", "301": "Selection of Strategies In coordination with public input (which is described in greater detail in  Chapter 3.7), the planning team assesses the relative merits and costs  of each adaptation strategy within a given focus area to prioritize the  preferred adaptation strategy. This may be accomplished through a ben- efit-cost analysis, alternatives analysis, stakeholder feedback, or even  new output from a tool utilized during the Vulnerability Assessment.  Communities that have already gone through this process have also  identified the value of doing a business as usual baseline assessment18 that will help compare the costs anticipated by the adaptation strategies.  While adaptation strategies carry a cost, sometimes a significant one,  in the long run a benefit-cost analysis may show that properly planned  adaptation yields a tremendous savings as compared to doing nothing.", "302": "3.4. Integrate into Existing Plans Adaptation Planning outcomes are very effective when integrated into  specific local planning products. Below is a list of eight planning prod- ucts that may already exist in a local community that are appropriate  to amend with adaptation planning strategies.19 A Local Comprehensive Plan (LCP) is required of all Florida counties  and municipalities, guiding future growth and development. LCP pol- icies generally influence a communitys day-to-day land use decisions  and capital facilities expenditures. These policies play a major role in  determining local development patterns, which in turn determine the  degree to which people and property are exposed to natural hazards,  injury, and damage. Examples of communities who have already incor- porated AAAs in their LCP are included in Chapter 3.6, Best Practices. Florida local agencies are now required to integrate or add accom- modations for the 2015 Peril of Flood Statute [163.3178(2)(f) 1-6]  into their Local Comprehensive Plan. Signed into law by Governor Rick  Scott on May 21, 2015, this requirement should be contained in a new  or existing redevelopment component of their coastal management  planning element. This component should eliminate inappropriate and  unsafe development in the coastal areas when opportunities arise.", "303": "Much of the data analysis and mapping performed for a robust  response to the Peril of Flood requirement can also contribute to a  Vulnerability Assessment. The Local Mitigation Strategy (LMS) is usually developed at the county  level and serves to reduce the risks associated with natural and man- made disasters, including sea level rise. It is a connection between the  Local Comprehensive Plan, the emergency management plan, the cap- ital improvements plan, land development regulations, building codes,  and key ordinances such as those for floodplain management.  A Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) is a broad-reaching plan  providing for natural resource protection and reasonable coastal-de- pendent economic growth and contains a detailed and comprehensive  statement of policies, standards, and criteria to guide public and pri- vate uses of lands and waters as well as mechanisms for timely imple- mentation in specific geographic areas within the coastal zone. SAMPs  also provide for increased specificity in protecting natural resources,  improved protection of life and property in hazardous areas, including  those areas likely to be affected by sea level rise, as well as improved  predictability in government decision making. 16 USCS  1453 (17),  [Title 16. Conservation; Chapter 33. Coastal Zone Management]. An Economic Development Plan (EDP) provides an overview of the  economy, sets policy direction for economic growth, and identifies strat- egies, programs, and projects for improvement. These policies and strat- egies can guide future investment and economic growth or activities to  areas that are safe and that have reduced exposure to hazard risks. 20 Peril of Flood Statute. SB 1094, 2015. Florida 163.3178(2)(f) 1-6. Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 43 42 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook A post-disaster redevelopment plan (PDRP) is encouraged for all com- munities. A PDRP identifies policies, operational strategies, and roles  and responsibilities for implementation that will guide decisions that  affect long-term recovery and redevelopment of a community after a  disaster. PDRPs emphasize seizing opportunities for hazard mitigation  and community improvement consistent with the goals of the Local  Comprehensive Plan and with full participation of the citizens.  A capital improvements plan (CIP) guides the scheduling of spending  on public improvements, such as capital projects and equipment pur- chases. A CIP can serve as an important mechanism for guiding future  investments and improvements away from identified hazard areas. It  can be used to modify an existing project to add a mitigation/resilience  component. A stormwater management plan (SMP) is designed to address flood- ing associated with stormwater runoff. A stormwater management  plan is typically focused on design and construction measures that are  intended to reduce the impact of more frequently occurring but minor  (from a flooding standpoint) urban flooding that impacts water quality. A historic preservation plan (HPP) is intended to preserve historic  structures or districts within a community. An often-overlooked aspect  of the historic preservation plan is the assessment of buildings and  sites located in areas subject to natural hazards and the identification  of ways to reduce future damages.", "304": "NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Land  Cover Atlas and Coastal Comparison Tool", "305": "Funding Opportunities Funding opportunities to complete adaptation planning or projects  can come from a variety of sources. DEP has a Coastal Partnership Ini- tiative with annual grant funding and the Clean Water State Revolving  fund provides access to low interest loans. DEO funds technical assis- tance grants for planning purposes. The EPA and FEMA have several  grant programs as well. See Appendix 6.2 for more details about spe- cific funding programs", "306": "3.7. Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation The Adaptation Strategies step is the most solution-based part of the  Adaptation Planning process. An extensive public involvement component  is appropriate for this point and should build off the findings of the Vulner- ability Assessment. Unique local solutions are only possible when people  with different expertise and interests come together and collaborate. Structured discussion will help guide collaboration and keep the con- versation on task and productive. It is possible to delve into great  depth on particular issues and this type of detail is not always appro- priate in settings with large numbers of attendees. Questionnaires sent  to participants before the workshops that ask about their goals and  expectations for the workshop can be especially helpful as is a second  questionnaire sent after the workshop to ask participants about how  they would like to make use of the Adaptation Plan in their respective  departments.23 As learned during the pilot community projects, local officials want  to better understand their options and constraints. Knowing both the  local context as well as what has been done in other parts of Florida will  enable local officials to make informed decisions. Information pertaining  to both is appropriate to include in public materials and discussions.", "307": "Once a set of adaptation strategies has been developed and analyzed, it  is time to transition to implementation activities to move the strategies  from plan to action. This process includes identifying, preparing for, and  applying for potential funding opportunities; creating a schedule of adap- tation actions for the future; and monitoring and evaluating progress. Implementation strategies are the specific steps a community takes to  incorporate the adaptation strategies into existing planning, budgeting,  and staffing mechanisms. The Assess Adaptive Capacities sub-com- ponent (Chapter 3.1) should outline the ability of the community to  take action. Even before the Vulnerability Assessment is conducted,  communities may want to consider possible implementation strate- gies based on available capacities, existing implementation schedules,  or available funding sources. Communities must be able to support  and implement adaptation activities to successfully reduce the neg- ative impacts of potential sea level rise that were identified during a  Vulnerability Assessment. The ability to implement can increase over  time, so communities should not simply settle for what is available at  the current time but expect that, as they undertake the first round of  implementation, their knowledge and capacity will grow. The Implementation Strategies component contains most of the adap- tation plans logistics  the actions and functions that need to take  place for the product (adaptation strategies) to be delivered.

Survey of Funding Options  It is recommended that a systematic review of all known funding  sources, as well as inquiry into new funding opportunities that may  facilitate a successful implementation strategy, be completed. The availability of funds is often a key determinant as to what activi- ties could be undertaken. Funding can originate at non-profit, private,  local, state, and federal levels. It may originate from a source such  as penny sales tax, tax-increment financing, cooperative banking, or  grants. Available grants often change, but the following list identifies  agencies that may offer grants to fund adaptation strategies as well as  past and current grant examples:   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  Office  for Coastal Management Broad Agency Announcement for  special projects   US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  P3 awards: A national  student design competition for sustainability   US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)   Community Development Block Grants Chapter 4: Implementation Strategies52 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook   Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)  Florida  Coastal Partnership Initiative   Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO)  Community  Resiliency Technical Assistance Grants   Local land conservation trusts (such as the Florida Keys Environ- mental Restoration Trust Fund) The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may also pro- vide several kinds of assistance to communities who have prepared  a local mitigation strategy that conforms to the standards set forth  in the Code of Federal Regulations (44 CR 201.6). If the community  has developed a hazard mitigation plan that is recognized by the State  (under Section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer- gency Act as amended April 2013), then some examples of applicable  FEMA funding that can be applied to coastal Protection, Accommoda- tion, and Retreat measures are as follows:   Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)   Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)   Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) FEMA makes the Hazard Mitigation Assistance guidance, which pro- vides the detailed information on these mitigation grant programs,  available annually. In some instances, funding can be obtained to assist  with the Vulnerability Assessment component also. Hazard Mitigation  Plans (known locally in Florida as the Local Mitigation Strategy or LMS),  which can be funded under HMGP and PDM, can also include Avoid- ance measures.", "309": "After major disasters, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment (HUD) can provide mitigation grants under its Community Devel- opment Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program when  Congress approves a disaster supplemental. The eligible activities vary  from disaster to disaster and would be provided in the Federal Register  notice along with the State Action Plan that must be developed. In addition, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), under  the US Department of Agriculture, has two programs that may be  available to communities: the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP)  Program and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention (WFPO)  Program. The EWP Program is a federal emergency recovery program  available after disasters and offers assistance to communities to relieve  imminent threats to life and property caused by natural disasters that  impair a watershed. The WFPO is a cooperative program between the  federal government, states, and locals to prevent floodwater and sed- iment damage and erosion and work towards conservation of water  and land in authorized watersheds.

It is important to maintain a balance  between the urgency of the moment to address current risks while  showing foresight to plan for future impacts. In several instances, it is a  minimal cost to add an additional safety margin to a project which will  also help maintain the projects effectiveness as vulnerability and risk  may increase over time. Keep in mind that many facilities and infra- structure are built to last 30 to 50 years, if not longer, and future risk  Different types of prioritization  reflect where the urgency is,  community acceptance, and  what can get the biggest bang  for the buck. It is better to  establish the criteria upfront. Chapter 4: Implementation Strategies54 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook in the latter stages of developments useful life should be factored.  Consideration of all possible options and the related costs and benefits  of each will allow for a no-regrets strategy to be designed. Priorities should be based on risks identified and potential losses as  a result of those risks and reviewed in relation to funding, ability to  implement, and consistency with other plans. FEMA and NOAA (2013)  have developed a comprehensive but quick checklist of considerations  known as STAPLEE that help evaluate each proposed action:24   Social  What are the socially acceptable adaptation strategies in  the community?   Technical  What are the technically feasible adaptation strategies  within the community?   Administrative  Which adaptation strategies are implementable  by community leadership?   Political  Which adaptation strategies are politically acceptable  within the community?   Legal  Which adaptation strategies are legally implementable by  the community under state and municipal law?   Economic  What are the cost-effective adaptation strategies avail- able to the community?   Environmental  Which adaptation strategies are most favorable  to the environment as determined by community conservation  plans and statewide guidance? By using the STAPLEE categories, a community may prioritize adapta- tion strategies that meet local capacity and preferences. The STAPLEE  method can evaluate costs in relation to benefits of implementing  one particular action over another. Using STAPLEE serves as a reality  check that helps communities avoid putting too much effort into a  type of action that has little chance of success due its particular cir- cumstances, preferences, history, and culture. An informal cost-benefit analysis can also be used to review proposed  adaptation actions. Ratings of high, medium, or low can be assigned  to the anticipated costs and the benefits associated with each action  based on general criteria that are established by the community.  Examples of ratings could include criteria such as:    High cost  existing funding is not adequate.    Medium cost  existing funding would require budget reapportionment  or amendment.   Low cost  funding available under existing budget.   High benefit  action would have a significant impact on risk reduction.   Medium benefit  action would have an impact on risk reduction.   Low benefit  long-term benefits are difficult to quantify in short term.", "312": "This methodology provides a framework for the  overall costs and benefits of each action to be con- sidered when setting priorities. As described in  Chapter 3, there are situations where the impacts  from sea level rise are significant and already  present or imminent that may warrant taking on  the bigger challenges in the near term even if all  the funding needed is not presently identified.  Prioritization enhances the impact of Focus Area- driven adaptation strategies by ensuring that  the community adds additional aspects to the  comprehension of coastal flooding in the greater  context and functioning of the community.", "313": "4.2. Create a Schedule of Activities, Actions,  and Actors Creating a Schedule of Activities, Actions, and Actors takes the sec- ond half of implementation into account  providing impetus to the  actions to be completed and the agency/department/staff responsi- ble for each action. This sub-component can serve to program differ- ent types of adaptation activities according to their prioritized need  (see Chapters 3.2 and 4.1.1) and, in pairing with funding opportunities,  generate a concise and easy-to-follow plan. To create a schedule that is flexible yet delegates responsibility, the  planning team should identify the appropriate responsible party who  has the ability to complete a task, activity, or strategy.25 The plan- ning team may then schedule their monitoring and evaluation (see  Chapter 4.3) to follow up with the responsible local staff member.  Scheduling transfers responsibility to the implementing entity to  set and maintain timelines while ensuring that a coordinating group  remains informed and responsive to the activity as it is carried out  and later evaluated. However, due to the multi-disciplinary approach  needed to undertake many adaptation measures, it is recommended  that support personnel be assigned to projects to assist the primary  with the additional skill sets, knowledge base, and contacts needed to  successfully implement a project. Scheduling activities and assigning staff may emphasize the util- ity of planning ahead as the various elements of the schedule come  online. By naming the person or group responsible for each activitys  implementation, more accurate timelines can be made which may  economize the implementation process. As discussed in Chapter 3.4,  integrating adaptation into existing plans, if the strategy involves incor- porating activities into a regulatory document, provides an opportu- nity to program capacity building measures. For this sub-component,  the planning team is encouraged to consider consultants outside of  local government staff. A diverse set of participants within the steering  committee could connect individuals or entities from a wide berth in  the private sector, non-profits, and universities.", "314": "4.3. Monitor and Evaluate In order to ensure that adaptation  strategies continue to serve their  intended purpose  to robustly  respond to the community priori- tized sea level rise vulnerabilities   it is recommended that an adapta- tion plan include a Monitoring and  Evaluation component. Monitoring  and Evaluation extends throughout  the horizon of the plans implemen- tation, which could extend for many  years. The ability to communicate  the guiding goals of the plan across iterations of implementing manag- ers is essential. This is done through a Monitoring and Evaluation plan  that uses consistent criteria, such as indicators that can be tracked  throughout the implementation horizon, and rated by different imple- menting managers. For this sub component, the planning team is encouraged to use indi- ces or performance indicators to easily determine if an adaptation  strategy is performing adequately. For example, point values could be  assigned based on various levels or percentages of project completion  to measure the progress towards completion, or project benchmarks  or major milestones could be established to track accomplishments  and project status. Monitoring of the adaptation strategies is a check-in to see that strate- gies are being carried out as anticipated and intended. This can include  review of successful actions identified and implemented, review of  barriers or obstacles to implementation for strategies that were iden- tified but not completed, need for revisions to activities based on  review, and reevaluation of proposed timelines based on new informa- tion on impacts and funding. Once the progress attained is evaluated,  activities can be revised where needed to make certain the adaptation  plan goals are being achieved. Revisions and updates of the strategies  can also consider potential changes in hazard vulnerability, local capa- bilities and resources, and risk reduction priorities. Lessons learned  during the implementation should be shared across the community  and even with other communities to expand the knowledge base of  what is working, what would work better with some modifications,  and the pitfalls to avoid. In addition to monitoring activities, it is important to revisit the data  and methodologies that go into the Vulnerability Assessment. Of these,  the sea level rise projection model may be one of the most important  aspects of an adaptation plan to monitor. Over an example horizon of  five years, global climate models and viewing tools may increase their  accuracy and level of representation. The planning team can respond to  this by incorporating model update results into new iterations of their  adaptation plan. For example, new projection model updates could  project a faster or slower rate of sea level rise, and therefore, the plan- ning horizon and timelines for implementation of adaptation activities  may be adjusted to reflect the updated or best available information. Monitoring and Evaluation  should be approached with  an Adaptive Management  mindset to constantly strive  to improve the approach as  lessons learned are obtained  and new data is available. This  sustained effort helps keep the  planning process viable over  many years and should help  build momentum to adapt to  the changing environment.Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 59 58 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook Post-disaster evaluation efforts  are a productive combination  with adaptation monitoring and  updates. Moreover, if a commu- nity experiences a disaster event,  more attention will shift toward  adaptation efforts, and higher inci- dences of buy-in for certain adap- tation activities may arise. Partic- ularly, larger-scale disaster events  could greatly accelerate the imple- mentation schedule. Therefore,  the schedule of activities can be  changed to reflect new timelines  for more robust measures.", "315": "4.5. Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation Outreach can be one of the most important activities within a program  because it can lead to municipal action in the future. Increased stake- holder engagement throughout the adaptation planning process can  help to create buy-in amongst the public which can then in turn lead  to greater political support for adaptation actions in the community.  Holding public meetings, forums, or workshops that include business  groups, residents, and other community stakeholders can provide an  opportunity to educate participants and receive feedback based on  their understanding of local vulnerabilities to sea level rise and poten- tial responses. It can also be used as an opportunity to establish a con- nection between incremental improvements to citizen and property  safety and welfare and a more desirable future community.

In 2007, According to the National  Ocean Economics Program (NOEP), the coastal  zone was home to an estimated 127 million people,  supported 57 million jobs, and contributed $6.7 trillion  to the U.S. economy, accounting for 42 percent of  the U.S. population and 49 percent of its national  economic output (NOEP 2009a).  In its 2009 State of the U.S. Ocean and Coastal Economies  report, the NOEP provided a snapshot of the 6 A Planning Guide for State Coastal Managers ocean economy. The ocean economy consists  of economic activities that are tied to the ocean or  Great Lakes, or that are partially related to the ocean  or Great Lakes, and are located in a shore-adjacent  zip code. In 2004 (the most recent year for which  the information is available), the ocean economy  contributed $138 billion to the U.S. economy:  Tourism and recreation: $70 billion  Marine transportation: $28 billion  Offshore minerals: $20 billion  Ship and boat building: $11 billion  Living resources: $7 billion  Marine construction: $3 billion Measuring the ocean economy is complicated, and  data are limited. In order to make data compatible and  comparable across all six sectors, some sector data  were excluded in the NOEP study. Sector-specific  reports from other sources, which use different  definitions, methodologies, and parameters, can  provide greater detail. For example, NOAAs National  Marine Fisheries Service reported that the commercial  fishing industry generated over $103 billion in sales  and $44 billion in income in 2006. That same year,  recreational fishing contributed $82 million in sales  (largely in durable equipment) to the U.S. economy  and generated $38 billion in value-added impacts  (NOAA n.d. Fisheries). The coasts also provide a number of services that do  not have traditional market values but in total may  be even more valuable than those that do. The value  of coastal wetlands, for example, has been estimated  to be between $3 and 13 million per km2 (Knogge  et al. 2004). And, additional research suggests that  the storm protection services they provide are worth  $23.2 billion annually (Costanza et al. 2008).

They are already subject to  an array of social and environmental stressors  that have resulted in habitat loss and conversion,  habitat degradation, and overexploitation. Key  stressors include coastal development, storms  and other natural processes (e.g., erosion  and subsidence), deforestation, pollution,  invasive species, unsustainable and destructive  fishing practices, recreational activities, energy  development, etc. Climate change, defined by  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) as any change in climate over time,  whether due to natural variability or as result of  human activity, will exacerbate these stressors  (IPCC 2007a). Implications are expected to be far  reaching for coastal communities, economies, and  ecosystems (Karl et al. 2009).  Since 1900, the global average surface temperature  of the Earth has risen by about 1.5F (Karl et al.  2009). And, the 2000s decade (2000-09) was the  warmest on record, with 9 of its 10 years (2001- 09) ranking among the top 10 warmest years on  record (NOAA 2010a). Significantly, it was the  global warming that occurred over the last 50 years  that accounts for the majority of the increase,  which is largely attributable to human activities (i.e.,  greenhouse gas emissions). In the United States, the  average temperature has risen more than 2F over  the last 50 years (Karl et al. 2009). ", "326": "The IPCC has projected a likely rise in the average  global surface temperature of an additional 2 to 11.5F  by 2100 (relative to the 1980-99 time period) based on  an assumption of no changes in climate policy. In the  United States, the average temperature is projected to  increase by approximately 7 to 11F under a higher  emissions scenario and by approximately 4 to 6.5F  under a lower emissions scenario (Karl et al. 2009).  In addition to increases in air temperature, there is  evidence that other associated changes are taking place.  Some of these climate change phenomena, which are  discussed throughout this guide, include rising sea levels,  declining Great Lake levels, increasing storm intensity/ frequency (tropical and cold-season storms), changing  precipitation patterns, increasing water temperature, and  ocean acidification. The effects of these changes are  being observed across all sectors in the United States and  around the world (Karl et al. 2009).  Our understanding of the effects of climate change  on the United States is still evolving. According to the  U.S. Global Change Research Program, future changes  in some phenomena are more difficult to project than  others (e.g., changes in precipitation are more difficult to  project than changes in temperature) (Karl et al. 2009).  A lot remains uncertain and depends on the success of  our efforts to mitigate climate change. Nevertheless,  despite the uncertainties, current climate change  projections are considered reliable enough to warrant  and support adaptation planning (Karl et al. 2009).

Other plans that  may relate to climate change adaptation include coastal  management, watershed management, emergency  operations, transportation, economic development, and  growth plans. These plans are also excellent resources  for the adaptation plans vulnerability assessment and  adaptation strategy.  Know what your state is thinking about climate  change adaptation planning, both short and long  term, and where your program best fits into the  process. Also, look into how adaptation planning  is being handled at the local level in your state and  consider how to incorporate existing efforts into your  plan and/or how your plan can be used to guide and  support local planning. A new state law or executive order authorizing the  climate change adaptation planning process would  help ensure it has adequate resources, support, and  legitimacy.

Much of the expertise can be secured when  building the planning team. You will need  people who understand and track the science  as well as people who can take the science and  state-specific data and help decipher what it  may mean for your coastal areas. This will likely  require information technology ranging from  basic geographic information systems (GIS) to  sophisticated modeling programs. Understand  the limitations of your states computing  capacity before acquiring the latter. If you do  not have access to the technical expertise or  the necessary computing capacity, you may  want to consider contracting with a university,  consulting firm, or other technical partner.

Coordination and collaboration with  these entities is vital to the success of the adaptation  plan. You may prefer to conduct your vulnerability  assessment before you build the planning team, but  having the team in place first means more resources,  and likely better information, are available for the  assessment.

More information about how to involve  stakeholders, including the general public, who may  not be directly involved as part of the planning team,  is presented in the next section. Most of the state  and federal partners on the planning team will likely  already be aware of the need to adapt to climate  change impacts. If not, be sure to educate them as  you would other stakeholders as discussed in the next  step. Planning is a partnership- and consensus-building  exercise that requires a variety of skills and expertise.  It will allow coordination and integration of activities  across agencies, organizations, and jurisdictions,  capitalizing on human, technical, and financial  resources and avoiding unnecessary redundancies.  It should be an inclusive process that allows  diverse concerns to be addressed, considered, and  incorporated. And, it will also require creativity and  compromise. Your climate change adaptation planning team will  be responsible for overseeing, coordinating, and  advocating climate change adaptation from planning  through implementation and beyond. Ideally,  members of the planning team will be engaged in  climate change issues or be willing to become so, be  able to provide needed input to the process, and have  the support of their employers.  It may be necessary to have a formal invitation  process, which could include asking agency and  department heads (or other figures of authority)  to designate appropriate representatives to serve  on the planning team. This can help ensure the  representative has some level of authority to act on  behalf of the organization. Such a request could  be sent as a letter explaining the need for the plan,  the planning process, and the role of planning team  members, which could include:  Participating in planning meetings  Providing input and information for the  vulnerability assessment  Participating in goal setting  Identifying adaptation actions for the plan  Reviewing and commenting on plan drafts  Assisting with outreach activities   Monitoring implementation of activities  specific to their organizations  Contributing to plan review and updating  activities  Working to mainstream climate change  adaptation into other agency activities Your climate change adaptation planning team will  cross levels of government and sectors. Inclusion of  a wide variety of partners will result in a coast better  prepared for the impacts of climate change. As you  structure the planning team, some of the questions for  consideration include:  What entities engage in activities that might impact or stress coastal systems and activities  managed by the coastal management program?  What other agencies and organizations have  investments or management responsibilities in  the coastal zone?", "338": "Who is already, or planning to be, engaged in  planning for climate change adaptation, directly  or indirectly?

There is no one size fits all solution  for stakeholder participation. You will need to  review and choose those methods and techniques  that are most likely to result in effective and  efficient stakeholder participation in your state  (NOAA 2007a).  As the plan takes shape, ask for stakeholder input  on the vulnerability assessment (stakeholders may  have knowledge about past events and exposure  and have opinions about which community  assets should be protected), brief them on the  vulnerability assessment findings and invite  comment, involve them in goal setting and action  selection, get their feedback on the final plan, and  engage them in implementation and monitoring  activities, as appropriate.

The table of phenomena, impacts, and consequences  in Chapter 2 provides a national overview of the  climate change phenomena expected to be of greatest  importance in coastal regions.  These phenomena are:  Rising Sea Levels  Declining Great Lake Levels  Increasing Storm Intensity/Frequency  Changing Precipitation Patterns  Increasing Air Temperature   Increasing Water Temperature  Ocean Acidification Because of the strong regional variations in most of  these phenomena, and based on the scope of the  plan, the planning team will need to decide which  phenomena to include in its vulnerability assessment.  There are a number of resources available to help with  this decision and to provide input into other steps of  this assessment. The U.S. Global Climate Research  Programs Global Climate Change Impacts in the United  States, which contains information about potential  impacts by region and is the authoritative source on  climate change science and impacts in the United States,  provides a good starting point. Other good resources  for existing projections include research institutions  (especially Sea Grant institutions), regional climate  centers, state climatologists, and NOAA Regional  Integrated Sciences and Assessments programs.  From this research, the planning team should be able  to collect preliminary information about the climate  change phenomena that may affect the states coast in  the future.

There are a number of ways to categorize and address  these potential impacts and consequences. While this  guide categorizes them by phenomenon, you may  choose to approach them differently (e.g., by impact,  sector, or type of environmentnatural vs. built).  Based on the phenomena identified in Step 2.1, the  planning team will identify the associated impacts and  consequences. The resources consulted in Step 2.1  and the information in Chapter 2 and Appendix C can  provide an idea of these impacts. Many, if not all, of  these impacts will have been experienced in the past  and are likely to be exacerbated by climate change.  The planning team may choose to address all of these  impacts, and others, or may choose to limit them based  on the scope of the plan.  By establishing a baseline that shows how climate  change-associated hazards and other stressors have  affected the planning area in the past, the team will  be better able to envision how they might affect it in  the future and will also be well-positioned to monitor  ", "351": "and respond to changes as they occur.

As  with human populations, not every system will be  equally positioned to respond. As data are collected  about natural resources, the planning team may want  to consider attributes of these systems that provide  a sense of how vulnerable they may be to climate  change and, thus, which systems may need the most  assistance preparing for and responding to climate  change. To gauge the potential vulnerability of your coastal  and marine ecosystems and habitats, consider the  following:  HealthHealthy systems may be less  vulnerable to the added stress of climate  change.  Management planResources that are  well-managed lead to improved biodiversity,  shore protection, and food security; a more  sustainable income; continuity of fish nursery  and breeding; continuity of feeding grounds;  and more attractive areas for visitors.  Monitoring programPrograms that  monitor systems for health, stress, and change  allow potential problems in those systems to  be identified and addressed early.  Space to migrateSystems with adequate  and appropriate space to migrate may be less  vulnerable and better able to adapt to sea level  rise and other climate change phenomena.  ConnectivitySystems that are connected  to other systems with similar community  structures can migrate if threatened.  Management integrationCoordination  of management efforts across jurisdictions  and owners allows systems to be managed  for common goals and objectives and can  promote connectivity.  Threatened, endangered, and other  protected speciesSystems with high  numbers of protected species may be more  sensitive and vulnerable to climate change.   StressorsSystems already threatened  by stressors such as coastal development,  invasive species, pollution, etc. may be more  vulnerable to climate change.  Impact thresholdsSystems at or  near their impact threshold (after which  their vulnerability increases) will be more  vulnerable to climate change.", "363": "According to the IPCC, adaptive capacity is the  ability of a system to adjust to climate change  (including climate variability and extremes) to  moderate potential damages, to take advantage of  opportunities, or to cope with the consequences  (IPCC 2007a).", "364": "Capacity can be described in terms of the ability  of your states governments and their populations  to prepare for, respond to, and recover from the  impacts of climate change.

Global climate models  use mathematical equations to simulate how, on  a global scale, the earths physical processes will  react to changes. It must be emphasized that while  models are extremely valuable tools for simulating  and understanding climate change, shortcomings", "370": "remain. Their main shortcomings are limited  observations, incomplete understanding of climate  processes and their interrelationships, imperfect model  representations of the processes, and relatively large  grid boxes that dont represent smaller terrain features  (Meted 2009). It is important to recognize these  deficiencies, understand the uncertainties, and consider  results from multiple models, as well as how results  track with observations, to account for the range of  uncertainty and variability among them.  To model climate change in your state, consider  1) using the results of the scenarios generated for  2100 for the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Report7 and adjusting global projections to account for local  conditions (e.g., add local subsidence projections  to global sea level rise projections) and to estimate  shorter-term projections or 2) downscaling global  climate data. Since global climate models have relatively coarse  spatial resolution, downscaling is required to achieve  the finer spatial resolution needed to understand  regional impacts. Downscaling should result in better  projections of how the phenomena may change in your  state and thus better inputs for other models and maps  to illustrate the potential impacts and consequences on  your coast.  ", "371": "Step 3.1: Set Goals There is no one set of goals that can be applied to  all coastal zones. They will vary based on a number  of factors, such as the type and magnitude of  projected climate change impacts and the vulnerable  assets as identified in the vulnerability assessment.  Other important factors include the availability of  financial, technical, and human resources and the  states acceptable level of impacts. Goals should  be clearly written, attainable, and measurable  (qualitatively or quantitatively).  After reviewing the vulnerability assessment  findings, a good starting point for goal setting is  to review goals established in other state plans/ programs (e.g., those for coastal management,  hazard mitigation2, emergency operations,  environmental preservation, economic development,  resource management, transportation, etc.).  Adaptation plans from other governments, state and  local, are also useful resources. Some of these plans  can be accessed online at http://collaborate.csc .noaa.gov/climateadaptation/.", "372": "Step 3.2: Identify Actions Since many of the impacts and consequences of  climate change are not new, simply exacerbated or  accelerated, actions to reduce them already exist and  are being implemented outside the context of climate  change. This chapter illustrates how familiar actions  can also be used to support climate change adaptation. However, some of these actions are likely insufficient  for addressing the scale of the potential changes. It  will take a combination of existing, reconfigured, and  new actions to meet the challenges of climate change.  Importantly, the potential impacts of climate change on  the coast should be considered in all related planning,  law and policy making, and investment activities.", "373": "While reviewing state plans for possible goals,  also look at the actions and consider the following  questions in regard to actions along the coast as well  as elsewhere in the watershed:  Are there any actions that directly address  climate change impacts along the coast?   Are there any actions that indirectly address  climate change impacts along the coast?  Are there any actions that could or should  be modified to help meet the goals of the  adaptation plan?   Are there any actions that are in direct conflict  with the goals of the adaptation plan? To ensure the plan is inclusive of all actions that  may affect your coast and to avoid duplication, you  may want to consider incorporating ongoing and  already planned activities in your plan. Additionally,  there may be actions that could be modified to meet  multiple purposes with shared resources. If there are  actions that might hinder efforts to meet adaptation  goals, try to work with the entity responsible for that  action to reach a mutually beneficial solution. As  mentioned before, coordination and collaboration  among other state agencies and stakeholders is  critical, both to capitalize on each others efforts  and to avoid conflicts that could prove difficult and  expensive to overcome in the future. Think broadly and do not be afraid to think big. Do  not worry about resource or technology constraints,  these issues will be raised during the evaluation  process, which will help the planning team narrow  down the list and prioritize the agreed upon actions.  Hold on to the list of actions that do not make the  initial cut. In the future, some of these actions may be  more appropriate and/or feasible. Finally, be creative. Actions can be built to encompass one or more  measures (see examples in the table on page 51) and  should be crafted so they can be clearly understood  (e.g., does the action involve planning, promoting,  encouraging, mandating, constructing, etc.). While not  all of the measures included here can be implemented  at the state level, they are examples of activities states  can support and promote to local governments. A  lot of climate change adaptation will take place at the  local level, and financial and technical assistance from  higher levels of government, as well as mandates, in  some instances, will be vital to secure the necessary  level of local commitment. Not all actions included in this guide will be suitable  for every situation. One action may be appropriate  in one location but not in another. Suitability will  depend on circumstances specific to each state and its  ", "374": "coastal zone and may require additional research, study,  legal review, and legislative or regulatory change.  ", "375": "Planning, Law Making, and Regulating A number of measures can be used to alleviate many  of the impacts and consequences of climate change  and will be critical to successful climate change  adaptation efforts. Importantly, these measures include  planning, law making, and regulating. Adaptation  will require new, and modifications to existing, plans,  laws, and regulations. Going forward, all planning and  rulemaking activities should consider climate change  and future conditions so outcomes support, and do not  deter, adaptation efforts. Measures listed in the table on page 51 and discussed  further at the end of the chapter are more likely to be  acceptable and effective if they result from a traditional  planning process such as the one presented in this  guide. These measures can be incorporated into the  adaptation planning process or that of an existing plan  (e.g., comprehensive, hazard mitigation, watershed  management, capital improvement, etc.). Alternatively,  the planning team may decide a measure requires its  own plan (e.g., because of scope or complexity).  One type of plan encouraged by the Coastal Zone  Management Act is the Special Area Management  Plan (SAMP). SAMPs are broadly defined in the act  as plans which provide for increased specificity in  protecting significant natural resources, reasonable  coastal dependent economic growth, improved  protection of life and property in hazardous areas,  including those areas likely to be affected by land  subsidence, sea level rise, or fluctuating water levels  of the Great Lakes, and improved predictability in  governmental decision making (CZMA 1972). SAMPs  and other plans with similar intents are especially  appropriate in areas where authorities overlap and  coordination and cooperation is required to effectively  address the multitude of needs that have arisen along  the coasts. Many local governments, and some states, have  comprehensive plans to guide development. Some  states require local governments to have such plans;  others provide incentives that encourage them. In  ", "376": "either case, states typically specify the elements that  should be included in local comprehensive plans. For  the purposes of adaptation, a new adaptation element  could be specified, adaptation measures could be  incorporated into existing elements (e.g., land use,  transportation, environment, natural hazards, etc.),  as appropriate, or local adaptation plans could be  incorporated by reference. In addition, to address  climate change, the timeframe of comprehensive  plans may need to extend further into the future.  Incorporating adaptation into local comprehensive  plans in some way lends them the strength of internal  consistency, which is required by some states, to ensure  local actions are taken based upon and consistent with  the legally adopted comprehensive plan. Research on local comprehensive plans as vehicles  for reducing insured losses in natural disasters  suggests that comprehensive plans that include hazard  mitigation can reduce such losses: losses are lower  in states that require comprehensive plans and even  more so in those that require comprehensive plans  to address hazards. However, research also suggests  that in the absence of a state mandate to prepare a  comprehensive plan and address hazards, the planning  efforts of many local governments are inadequate  (Burby 2005). While mandates may result in plans, they may not  have the desired effect if they do not consider existing  barriers to effective planning and/or if the plans are  not effectively implemented.3 When issuing or revising  a state mandate, consider the role of the state in the  oversight process and how it can enforce and monitor  plan implementation as well as development and content  (while maintaining flexibility for local decision making). Since plans are typically not legally binding,  governments may pass laws and ordinances and issue  implementing regulations to best achieve the desired  outcomes identified through the planning process,  especially when it comes to land use. The Second  National Assessment on Natural and Related Technological  Hazards states No single approach to bringing  sustainable hazard mitigation into existence shows  more promise at this time than increased use of sound  and equitable land-use management (Mileti 1999).  The same is likely to hold true for climate change  adaptation as well.", "377": "Regulation and Removal of Shore Protection Structures x x x x x", "378": "Step 3.3: Evaluate, Select, and  Prioritize Actions Unfortunately, there will be more things the  planning team wants to do than it will be able to,  for a variety of reasons. In this task, the planning  team will decide which of the actions identified in  the previous step are actually suitable for the states  unique set of circumstances and then prioritize them  for implementation. Decisions will need to be made;  difficult tradeoffs may be required. Much of this  discussion is based on FEMAs Developing the Mitigation  Plan: Identifying Actions and Implementing Strategies (2003). One way to evaluate the proposed actions is to  use a method that considers the Social, Technical,  Administrative, Political, Legal, Economic, and  Environmental (STAPLEE) opportunities and  constraints of each action. The information the  planning team generates from this evaluation process  will help them weigh the pros and cons of each action  to determine which are best for the state. There are  no right or wrong answers. The criteria are defined as  follows:  SocialThe action should be socially  acceptable.   Will the proposed action  disproportionately affect (positively or  negatively) one segment of the population? Actions will need to be evaluated based on criteria established  by the planning team and, once selected, prioritized for  implementation.  Is the action compatible with present and  future community values?  TechnicalThe action should be technically  feasible, help to reduce losses in the long term,  and have minimal cumulative and secondary  impacts.   How effective is the action in avoiding or  reducing future losses?  Will it create more problems than it solves?  Does it solve the problem or only address a  symptom?  AdministrativeThe action should be  implementable by the state. Can the state meet  the staffing and funding needs of the action or  will it need outside assistance?   Does the state have the capacity (staff,  technical expertise, and funding) to  implement and maintain the action, or can  it be realistically obtained elsewhere?  PoliticalThe action should be politically  acceptable.   Is there political support to implement and  maintain this action?  Is there a champion willing to help see the  action to completion?  Is there enough public support to ensure  the success of the action?  LegalThe state must have the legal authority  to implement/enforce the action.   Does the state have the authority to  implement/enforce the action?  Are the proper laws and regulations in place  to implement/enforce the action?  Are there any potential legal consequences?  Will the state be liable for the action or lack  of action?  Is the action likely to be challenged by  stakeholders who may be negatively  affected?  EconomicThe action should be cost- effective and be likely to pass a benefit-cost  analysis.  Are there currently sources of funds that  can be used to implement the action?", "379": "What benefits (market and nonmarket)  will the action provide?  Does the cost seem reasonable for the  size of the problem and likely benefits?  What burden will be placed on the tax  base or local economy to implement this  action?  Does the action contribute to or detract  from other community economic  goals, such as capital improvements or  economic development?  What are the economic consequences of  not implementing the action?  EnvironmentalThe action should meet  statutory considerations and public desire  for sustainable and environmentally healthy  communities.  How will the action affect the  environment (land, water, protected  species)?  Will the action comply with state  and federal environmental laws and  regulations?  Is the action consistent with state  environmental goals? Once the planning team has decided on the  acceptable actions given review of the criteria above  (or a different set of criteria), it should prioritize the  actions for implementation.

Specifically, models  and maps provide information about how climate  change might affect a planning area, lending support  to vulnerability assessments and communications  tools. They may also be used to illustrate the potential  outcomes of adaptation actions.  Models simulate reality to better understand how  changes in climate may impact natural and built  environments. Maps illustrate model outputs but  may also be basic graphic representations of certain  characteristics (e.g., social, physical, environmental) in  a geographic area. Model-based maps may be risk- based, event-based, or scenario-based. Risk-based maps  illustrate an event that has a specific probability of  occurring over a specific time frame (e.g., Digital Flood  Insurance Rate Maps). Event-based maps depict events  that have already occurred and their impacts. Scenario-", "390": "based maps illustrate the outcomes of a projected  event (or events). All can provide useful information  for climate change adaptation planning and project  implementation. These measures, modeling in particular, can be  extremely resource intensive and complex and  may require engaging experts, such as academics,  nongovernmental organizations, consultants, or  federal partners. Alternatively, pre-existing models  and maps can be used in their original form, or they  could be downscaled or improved upon through", "391": "the addition of data (e.g., Digital Flood Insurance  Rate Maps could be enhanced by adding future  conditions hydrology, erosion zones, or areas that may  be inundated by sea level rise).

In this guide, outreach  is the provision of information to all stakeholders  (anyone who will be affected by climate change  in your state), and education involves the formal  education system (typically kindergarten through  grade 12).  Purposes of outreach can include engaging  stakeholders in the planning effort, gaining support  for planning and action implementation, informing  the public about climate change and their role in  adaptation, communicating the benefits of natural  resources and ways to protect them, and changing  attitudes and behaviors. Outreach is not a one-time  activity. It should begin with the launching of the  adaptation planning effort and continue throughout  the process (as introduced in Chapter 3) and as  Using visuals to explain how coastal areas may be impacted  by climate change can build support for adaptation.  new information becomes available, milestones are  met, successes become evident, and whenever an  appropriate opportunity presents itself (e.g., when  the plan is released or when adaptation actions are  implemented that require support, adherence, or  assistance). There are numerous challenges to communicating  about climate change. The uncertainty of the  science and the presence of more immediate issues  are perhaps the biggest. While a few resources for  helping conduct outreach and craft and deliver  adaptation messages are noted at the end of the  chapter, the planning team should consider enlisting  communications specialists to help in this endeavor.  An outreach strategy can help guide climate change  adaptation communications and, similar to the  strategy for an adaptation plan, should identify goals  and actions to ensure stakeholders are being reached  in an effective manner. An outreach strategy involves  identifying the target population, conducting a  population profile (so the best way to communicate  with them is understood), crafting the message, and  then deciding how to disseminate it. There will likely  be multiple stakeholder groups/target populations  (e.g., planning team members and other participating  stakeholders, the general public, state and local elected  officials and other decision makers, developers,  resource managers, etc.) who may require tailored  messages and different delivery formats. ", "393": "As the strategy is drafted, the planning team should  consider what is already being done to reach the  target populations. Can climate change adaptation  be incorporated into existing government programs  for climate change mitigation, coastal management,  emergency management, public health, water  conservation, stormwater management, etc.? What  communications vehicles are planning team members  already using? Are there lessons learned that the  planning team can benefit from? As appropriate,  coordinate outreach efforts with federal activities,  including National Flood Safety Awareness Week,  Hurricane Preparedness Week, American Wetlands  Month, and others. Be prepared to take advantage of  windows of opportunity, which may come in the form  of extreme weather events (in your state or elsewhere);  the arrival of climate conditions that may affect your  state (e.g., annual storm seasons, El Nio, La Nia);  national media attention, etc. Effective communication has to achieve a match  between message content, framing, and the concerns  and values with which audiences resonate (Bostrom  and Lashof 2007). When communicating with the  public, consider geographic, socioeconomic, and  cultural differences. Who is most vulnerable? What  languages do they speak? What are their interests?  Surveys can help inform the planning team about  how stakeholders feel about climate change and  adaptation and what they value most and may help it  better understand how to engage them on the subject.  For instance, if some stakeholders have doubts about  climate change, or the term itself is too politically  charged, taking an approach that focuses on the impacts  and consequences, many of which they may have  already experienced or are familiar with, may be more  effective.4  A demonstration of the trends can illustrate  the need to take action.

Museums, libraries, nature centers and  preserves, and other informal education providers can  also serve as effective venues for dissemination of  information about climate change.  In addition to the education provided via the outreach  program, the planning team may want to work with the  states department of education to create programs to  educate teachers about climate change and to develop  curricula for the classroom. The primary goals of  these efforts should be to equip students with basic  information about climate change and to empower  them to take action and to build awareness among their  family and friends. Your state research institutions can  also provide input to these efforts.", "396": "Financial and Technical Assistance  Since a lot of climate change adaptation will be taking  place at the local level, it is in your states best interest  to build the capacity of local governments to respond  through both financial and technical assistance.  Financial support could be provided as competitive  or formula grants or could be targeted to specific  projects and pilots, which may also be accompanied  by technical assistance. By supporting pilot projects,  the state will be able to test out adaptation measures  in a limited number of communities before applying  them statewide. Financial assistance could also be  provided through incentives, where special funds are  only available where prerequisites established by the  state have been met. An example of a related incentive  program is the National Flood Insurance Programs  Community Rating System, which offers discounts on  flood insurance in participating communities. Technical assistance could also take a number of  forms. It could include the provision of training, data,  ", "397": "maps, models, GIS support, planning guidebooks,  model ordinances, and outreach materials. Once again,  survey the planning team to see what programs already  exist. Could adaptation be incorporated into them or  could their focus be shifted? Training advances outreach efforts and, as with  outreach, will likely have multiple target populations  and messages. Each program should address the  individual needs of the target population, which  could be elected officials; state and local planners,  natural resource managers, or building code officials;  developers; marine contractors; the general public; etc.  For example, a training program to educate elected  officials about their role in climate change adaptation  would look very different from a program designed to  teach marine contractors about living shorelines.  Many local governments already provide map  information services, where they respond to inquiries  regarding the location of a property in relation to  special flood hazard areas as well as its base flood  elevation. However, due to both financial and  technical constraints, this information may be limited  to information on a Digital Flood Insurance Rate  Map. Should the state expand mapping activities to  better capture the location of natural resources and  identify areas susceptible to other coastal hazards,  this information could be passed along (e.g., as GIS  overlays) to local governments to better inform their  map information service as well as their planning  efforts. In addition, this information could be used as  input to a coast-wide web mapping application that  would allow local governments and other stakeholders  to view the location of hazard-prone and natural areas.  In addition to providing data, maps, and models,  which will help lay the foundation for an adaptation  plan, the state can further support the planning  activities of local governments by providing  planning guidance, such as a local version of this  document customized for your state.

While growth  is often desirable and necessary, it must be managed in  a way that addresses the needs of the population and  also offers protection to natural resources and supports  the services they provide.  A robust planning program is essential to effectively  manage growth and development, and it is widely  recognized that land use planning is an effective way  to reduce risks associated with natural hazards (Burby  1998). While most growth will be managed locally,  there is still a role for the state to play, including  restricting growth where it affects state lands and  offering assistance and disincentives (e.g., not providing  funding for infrastructure or other services that will  encourage growth in inappropriate areas) to local  governments.

A number of the measures discussed in this  guide can be implemented through zoning.  Zoning can be used to regulate parcel use, density of  development, building dimensions, setbacks, impervious  surfaces, type of construction (e.g., easily movable),  shore protection structures, landscaping, etc. It can also  be used to regulate where development can and cannot  take place, making it an invaluable tool in efforts to  protect natural resources and environmentally sensitive  areas and guide development away from hazard-prone  areas. Permissible uses and standards vary by zoning  district. Types of districts include general use districts;  overlay districts, where provisions in addition to those  on the underlying districts apply; and special use  districts, in which all uses require permits.  Floodplain zoning is an example of a zoning application  that, if thoughtfully drafted, can provide multiple  benefits. In addition to protecting life and property,  benefits of floodplain zoning can include resource  conservation, open space preservation, public access,  and water-quality protection. Floodplain regulations that  just meet the minimum requirements of the National  Flood Insurance Program are more focused on how to  build safely in the floodplain and may not provide the  additional benefits", "401": "As the climate changes, adjustments will need to be  made.

For example,  regulations that limit building height may need to be  altered in light of changing elevation requirements.  Your state may want to encourage local governments  to review the adequacy of their zoning, make changes  and additions as appropriate, and to consider climate  change in future zoning decisions. As the need for  new districts arises, model language can help ease the  process and advance state interests.

A building lost to one  storm is likely to be lost to another if built back  on its prestorm footprint and without significant  structural improvements. Despite the desire to  return to prestorm conditions, it is important  to build back right. Combining restrictions with  acquisition/demolition/relocation programs  provides safer options to property owners in the  wake of the loss of or damage to their homes or  businesses. Such restrictions will likely be more  acceptable if adopted prior to a disaster rather than  during recovery.  Restrictions could apply to repetitive losses or  severe repetitive losses as defined by FEMA, or  they could apply to any structure in a particular  area (e.g., the 100- or 500-year floodplain) that is  destroyed or substantially damaged. A prohibition  on redevelopment of structures destroyed or  substantially damaged by storms or chronic erosion  would serve multiple purposes. It would protect  life and property by removing them from harms  way and allow the natural and beneficial functions  of the floodplain to return. However, an outright  prohibition is often politically and practically  difficult to implement (though less so when public", "403": "health or access is at stake). Restrictions that attach  provisions to reconstruction, such as siting, design, and  construction requirements, are often more achievable. At a minimum, where rebuilding is allowed, general  permitting requirements for new construction  should be enforced, including for those structures  that were nonconforming prior to their loss.  In addition, rebuilding after a loss provides an  opportunity to include additional measures that will  better protect the building and the land on which it  resides", "404": "Conservation Easements A conservation easement is a legal agreement between  a landowner and a land trust or government agency  that can be used to restrict development in sensitive  and hazard-prone areas. Unlike acquisition and open  space preservation and conservation, which are also  useful tools for managing where development takes  place and are discussed in the Loss Reduction and  Coastal and Marine Ecosystem Management categories,  respectively, easements may not preclude other land  uses and allow property to remain in private ownership.  Landowners can sell or donate their easement.  Easements that are sold are also known as PDRs  (purchase of development rights). Landowners who  donate their easement may be eligible for federal  or state tax breaks. Easements typically apply in  perpetuity and are passed on from owner to owner.  Most are placed on individual properties, but they  may also be placed on subdivisions or coordinated  at a regional scale (e.g., to more effectively manage a  strip of shoreline or accommodate beach and wetland  migration).

", "406": "Compact Community Design Compact community design7  allows development  to occur while protecting natural resources. It is  a pattern of development that aims to use land  more efficiently by grouping a mixed-use of buildings  together, minimizing their collective footprint, and  leaving undeveloped land in its natural state.8  More  open space and fewer impervious surfaces means  reduced runoff and flooding. It also means reduced  investments in services and infrastructure design,  construction, and maintenance. Compact communities  are also known for their walkability, thus compact  community design also helps mitigate climate change. The high density development suggested by compact  community design can allow for more opportunities  to guide development away from sensitive and hazard- prone areas, but without proper planning, it can lead  to increased susceptibility to hazards. Any such design  must still consider the location of hazard-prone  areas as well as the location and carrying capacity of  evacuation routes. Compact community design is best  implemented in conjunction with zoning ordinances  that regulate development in hazard-prone areas and  strong building codes.", "407": "Along heavily developed coastlines, compact  community design may be difficult to implement  since little undeveloped open land will be available.  Nonetheless, there are times when opportunities  may present themselves, including when planning  economic redevelopment projects, when previous  uses on large tracts of land are no longer supported  (e.g., military facilities are closed down), and in the  aftermath of a disaster.", "408": "Acquisition, Demolition, and Relocation The most effective way to reduce losses is to acquire  hazard-prone properties, both land and structures,  demolish or relocate structures, and restrict all future  development on the land. Generally, acquisition is  the best and most cost-effective hazard mitigation  alternative because it permanently removes people  and their homes from harms way (FEMA 1998). In  addition, it can reduce the emotional and financial  costs associated with response and recovery from  future storms, reduce flooding by restoring natural  floodplain functions and increasing flood storage  area, and support environmental and public access/ recreational goals.  While acquisition serves multiple purposes, this  discussion focuses on the acquisition of land  and associated structures that are vulnerable to  natural hazards. The open space preservation and  conservation discussion later in the chapter examines  the acquisition of property primarily for natural  resource protection. Acquisition programs, also known as buyout  programs, typically acquire land and structures and", "409": "require structures to be demolished or relocated  and the land to be deeded as open space in  perpetuity and restored to its natural condition to  allow for more appropriate uses. Factors involved  in the decision to demolish or relocate may include  cost-effectiveness (some structures are easier and  cheaper to move than others), condition of the  structures, property owner interests, availability of  land for relocation, etc. Acquisition/demolition  projects are typically easier to implement than  acquisition/relocation projects. It is a good idea to plan for acquisition by identifying  and prioritizing properties and structures for  acquisition. Target properties may include:  Properties that have suffered multiple losses  (e.g., repetitive loss and severe repetitive loss  properties)  Properties with structures that are  substantially damaged or destroyed  Properties (with and without structures) that  are in an identified hazard-prone area (e.g.,  floodway, sea level rise inundation area, special  flood hazard area, erosion hazard area)  Hazard-prone properties for which retrofitting  (e.g., elevating) is not cost-effective  Properties in potential wetland migration  corridors", "410": "While buyout programs are typically voluntary, where  property owners are not required to sell, other tools  for acquiring structures and property in hazard-prone  areas include exactions and eminent domain. In all  cases, a concerted planning effort, involving potential  sellers where applicable, should be undertaken to help  avoid piecemeal acquisition that might result in coastal  blight or a checkerboard pattern of homes and vacant  lots that would still require public services and may  diminish property values. The actual acquisition may  take place in advance of a hazard event or in the wake  of one, when funding, and willingness to sell, may be  easier to come by and when eminent domain may come  into play. Typically, relocation involves acquiring land and  relocating structures out of harms way rather than  demolishing them. Some relocation projects, for  example, where the majority of the structures are  substantially damaged or destroyed, may involve  demolition along with active efforts to relocate people  into new homes in safer areas. Relocation may occur  at different scales. It may involve moving individual  structures or moving neighborhoods. In some cases, it  may even involve moving entire communities. A plan for relocation that identifies potential structures  for relocation as well as sites that can accommodate  them will ease the process in the context of postdisaster  recoveryor in advance of sea level rise inundation. In  instances where a homeowner of a habitable structure  (i.e., not substantially damaged or destroyed) is interested  in acquisition but not relocation, there may be other uses  for the building that would justify its relocation (e.g., for  local government usage, Habitat for Humanity, domestic  violence shelter, etc.).", "411": "Setbacks While setback and buffer regulations as described  in this guide are similar in effect, they differ in  purpose. The discussion here focuses on the use  of setbacks largely for the purpose of protecting  structures from hazards by keeping the structures  away from a propertys most vulnerable areas. As  such, they are closely tied to other regulations that  manage development in hazard-prone areas, such  as redevelopment, floodplain management, and  shore protection structure regulations. Subdivision  regulations can require lots to be deep enough  to accommodate initial setbacks as well as future  relocations. And, building codes can ensure  structures can be moved with relative ease. Setbacks may be regulated at the state or local level, or  both, and may be based on size or use. Typically, they  require structures to be sited at a distance measured  inland from a specific shoreline feature, such as a high  water mark, vegetation line, dune toe, or bluff crest.  This distance may be a fixed number of feet (e.g., 100  feet) or may be based on the long-term annual rate of  erosion (e.g., 30 times the long-term annual rate of  erosion). Fixed numbers may not be adequate in highly  erosive areas and may be too restrictive in others; and  setbacks based on long-term average annual rates of  erosion do not currently account for how erosion  rates will change as sea level rises.

Building codes  that regulate design, construction, and landscaping of  new structures can improve the ability of structures  in hazard-prone areas to withstand hazard events  and can also reduce the effects of high temperatures.  They also indirectly protect neighboring structures  and natural resources. Building codes that consider  future conditions and the potential for climate change  and are regularly reviewed and updated based on new  information will provide even greater protection.  According to the Institute for Business and Home  Safety (IBHS 2005): A building code is the minimum acceptable standard used  to regulate the design, construction, and maintenance of  buildings for the purpose of protecting the health, safety,  and general welfare of the buildings users. The purpose of  building codes is to build safe buildings, thereby reducing  deaths, injuries and property damage. This preserves the  built environment, both residential and commercial, reduces  public and private disaster aid, and maintains employment  in businesses and institutions that otherwise might be  forced to close following a catastrophe. The level of protection provided by building codes  depends on the provisions of the codes as adopted  and enforced by state and local governments. State- imposed building codes can help ensure a minimum  level of protection. They may apply statewide, with  more stringent requirements in hazard-prone areas,  or they may apply only in areas susceptible to hazards  such as hurricanes. To provide even more protection  and address specific needs, states can allow local  governments to supplement the states minimum  requirements with additional provisions.  Many states and local building codes are based on  model codes founded on established scientific and  engineering principles. These model building codes  can be modified to better address specific needs and  hazards. The International Code Council maintains the  most up-to-date and widely adopted model building  codes, which incorporate multihazard disaster-resistant", "415": "construction standards. These codes include the  International Residential Code (single- and two- family structures) and the International Building  Code (commercial and multifamily structures).

Post-disaster assessments have proven that, in most  cases, the use and enforcement of stricter building codes  produce buildings that are more resistant to disasters  (FEMA 2000). However, the enforcement of these codes  is critical to their success. Local building departments are  typically responsible for ensuring builders comply with the  codes so structures provide the base-level of protection  required by the state or local government. Enforcement  activities include permit approval, design and plan review,  and site visits.

Buildings constructed in  the V-Zone, which is subject to coastal high hazard  flooding where waves during the base flood are at  least three feet, must also be elevated on pilings or  columns (i.e., fill is prohibited), and the bottom of  the lowest horizontal structural member must be  elevated to or above the BFE.

Existing structures can be protected from hazards  through retrofitting.12 While retrofitting may not  bring a structure up to code (unless required during  a substantial improvement), it does help existing  structures better withstand hazard events and may  reduce insurance premiums. Retrofitting techniques  exist for a number of hazards, including floods and  high winds, and many of them are similar to those  required in the construction of new structures.  Examples include:  Elevating or floodproofing flood-prone  structures   Reinforcing and bracing roofs and garage doors  Anchoring homes to their foundations  Installing shutters on windows and other glass  openings  Removing impervious surfaces  Replacing exterior building components with  stronger, more hazard-resistant alternatives Since retrofitting is typically not required, homeowners  may not be aware of what they can do to protect  their homes and themselves.

Since infrastructure is  critical to the functioning of a healthy community, it  must be sited, designed, constructed, and maintained  so the provision of services continues uninterrupted.  Infrastructure protection entails fortification against  the impacts of climate change and, in some cases,  shoring up of capacity. While many of the ideas discussed under building  codes and retrofitting also apply to infrastructure, the  value of infrastructure, both socially and economically,  suggests the need for stricter requirements for new  infrastructure construction (e.g., plan for the 500-year  event, rather than the 100-year event) and a more  concerted effort to retrofit existing facilities and  systems. Roads, bridges, water and power utilities,  stormwater systems, and other infrastructure that  are already worn or overcapacity are likely to be  most vulnerable to climate change.13 Addressing and  correcting existing deficiencies needs to be a priority  and should be handled concurrently with adjustments  necessary to meet projected future conditions and  needs. Similarly, adaptation should be considered and  incorporated into regular maintenance and upgrade  activities. In general, designing for the future is less expensive  than retrofitting, rebuilding, or moving infrastructure.  When planning for new infrastructure, siting should  be the first consideration. Facilities and system  components should not be constructed in hazard- prone (current or projected) or valuable natural  resource areas, where possible, or in areas that would  encourage undesirable growth.

However,  they often damage or destroy other valuable coastal  resources (economic, ecological, recreational, and  aesthetic), require substantial expenditure (initial  design and construction and maintenance), and create  a false sense of security. They may also encourage  additional development. Shore protection structures  provide an immediate fix that may not be sustainable.  Nevertheless, it is understood that in some cases,  for the purposes of protecting existing (not future)  development, there may be no other acceptable or  practical options. Alternatives to shore protection  structures are discussed in the Shoreline Management  category that follows.  Shore protection structures are designed to reduce  flooding/inundation and erosion of land and protect  structures and infrastructure. Despite the name, the  intent is to protect the built environment and the land  it sits on rather than the shore itself. 13 Onsite sewage disposal systems will also be vulnerable as sea levels rise and their separation from groundwater becomes inadequate.  Learning from othersMassachusetts Considers  Sea Level Rise in Infrastructure Siting In the 1990s, the Massachusetts Water Resources  Agency designed and built Bostons Deer Island  wastewater treatment plant in consideration of sea  level rise. Specifically, the plant was built 1.9 feet  higher than required at the time to accommodate  the amount of sea level rise projected to occur over  the expected lifetime of the facility (~50 years). And,  in a nod to climate change mitigation, the plant  gets approximately one-quarter of its power needs  through on-site renewable energy sources.  www.mwra.com/03sewer/html/sewditp.htm78 A Planning Guide for State Coastal Managers Most shore protection structures are built parallel or  perpendicular to the shoreline:   Shore parallel (seawalls, revetments, bulkheads,  breakwaters, rip rap)These structures help  hold the land back from the sea and the sea  back from the land and/or dissipate wave  energy.   Shore perpendicular (groins, jetties)These  structures interrupt sediment transport and  trap sediment to build/rebuild beaches and/or  stabilize navigational channels and inlets.  While they may be successful at meeting the level of  protection they are designed for, all of these structures  disrupt the natural flow of sediment, which may result  in the loss of the natural shoreline, coastal habitat, and  the associated ecosystem services and amenities, either  directly in front of the structure or in adjacent areas.  With the exception of breakwaters, which are built  offshore, shore parallel structures also inhibit the ability  of wetlands to migrate inland as sea level rises and may  interfere with public access. In most cases, protection in  one area will lead to losses in another (or the demand for  more shore protection structures), both to the built and  the natural environment. Large flood control systems like dikes (levees) and  movable gates and barriers (e.g., Maeslantkering in  the Netherlands and the Thames River Barrier in the  United Kingdom) are also being considered as viable  defenses against sea level rise. These structures require  significant investment and come with their own set of  concerns and adverse impacts.  When there are no suitable alternatives, future  shore protection structures should be designe", "424": "Regulation and Removal of Shore Protection  Structures As previously discussed, the use of shore protection  structures is only supported as an action of last resort  to protect valuable real estate and infrastructure. They  often do more harm to the natural shoreline than  good. To protect the natural shoreline and the benefits  it provides, states can use regulations to limit shoreline  hardening as well as to promote alternative forms of  protection and to encourage development that reduces  the needs for shore protection structures.  Regulations can specify allowable uses, locations,  and structures, prohibit new structures, and/or  require the removal of existing structures given  specified circumstances (e.g., no longer maintained,  substantially damaged, need to return land to  natural functions, etc.). The size, design, and  placement of shoreline stabilization structures can  also be regulated to minimize environmental and  public access impacts. Regulations that severely  restrict the use of shore protection structures or  require their removal should also require disclosure  of such restrictions in real estate transactions.", "425": "Rolling Easements Rolling easements are shoreline easements designed to  promote the natural migration of shorelines. Typically,  rolling easements prohibit shore protection structures,  which interfere with natural shoreline processes and  movement, but allow other types of development  and activities. As the sea rises, the easement, which  is usually delineated by a physical characteristic such  as the line of vegetation, moves or rolls landward,  sediment transport and wetland migration occur as  nature intended, and public access to the shore is  preserved. Since rolling easements reflect changing  conditions, they are likely to be a more effective  response to the impacts of climate change than  traditional zoning, which is based on conditions at the  time of the rule making. Rolling easements, which may be donated, purchased,  or regulated, place no restrictions on development.  They allow landowners to build anywhere on their  property with the understanding that they will not be  able to hold back the sea by armoring their shoreline  or deny public access. Once the shoreline has eroded  to a point where a privately owned structure is on  public land, a threat to human health and safety,  and/or threatened by flooding and erosion, that  structure should be relocated. The possible need for  relocation may encourage the building of smaller,  more mobile structures that will likely cause less  environmental disruption.", "426": "Living Shorelines In low- to medium-energy coastal and estuarine  environments and tidally influenced creeks,  streams, and rivers, living shorelines can be  effective alternatives to shore protection structures  in efforts to restore, protect, and enhance the  natural shoreline and its environment. Living  shorelines use stabilization techniques that rely on  vegetative plantings, other organic materials (e.g.,", "427": "biologs, matting), and sand fill or a hybrid approach  combining vegetative planting with low rock sills or  footers, living breakwaters (e.g., oysters), or other  shore protection structures designed to keep sediment  in place or reduce wave energy. The techniques and  materials used will depend on site-specific needs and  characteristics. There are a number of benefits to  living shorelines. Specifically, they:  Maintain natural shoreline dynamics and sand  movement   Trap sand to rebuild eroded shorelines or  maintain the current shoreline   Provide important shoreline habitat   Reduce wave energy and coastal erosion  Absorb storm surge and flood waters   Filter nutrients and pollutants from the  water   Maintain beach and intertidal areas that  offer public access   Are aesthetically pleasing  Allow for landward migration as sea levels  rise  Absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide  Are less costly than shore protection  structures  In some states, the regulatory framework makes  it more difficult to implement living shorelines  projects than the traditional shore protection  structures previously discussed. Regulations should  be reviewed and revised to encourage the use of  living shorelines where appropriate.  ", "428": "Beach Nourishment Beach nourishment is the process of placing sand  on an eroding beach, typically making it higher  and wider, to provide a buffer against wave action  and flooding and/or to improve the recreational  value of the beach. In the United States, beach  nourishment is preferred over shore protection  structures because it preserves the aesthetic  and recreational values of protected beaches by  mimicking the characteristics of natural beach  and dune systems. In addition to protecting the  nourished shoreline and landward property and  infrastructure, beach nourishment generally  benefits, rather than negatively impacts, adjacent", "429": "beaches (e.g., by adding sediment to the system) and  may also create, restore, and protect habitat. Beach nourishment projects require large volumes of  sediment compatible with the natural beach. These  sediments may come from onshore or offshore  sources and may be beneficial use sediments from  dredging projects. Some projects may include shore  protection structures to help retain/protect the added  sand (e.g., groins and breakwaters). Since nourished beaches will be susceptible to the  same natural forces as the beaches before them, they  will require periodic renourishment. Renourishment  intervals typically range from 2 to 10 years but will  vary by project, shoreline characteristics, number and  intensity of storms, and sea level rise (NRC 1995). Despite the benefits of beach nourishment, there  are some drawbacks to consider. Beach nourishment  projects:  Are very expensive and require regular  maintenance at additional costs  Require large amounts of suitable sediment  that may be difficult to come by  Are difficult to evaluate in terms of benefits  and costs due to the uncertainty of project  lifetime  Create a false sense of security that may  encourage unwise development  Can have serious long- and short-term  environmental effects at the project and  source sites and in nearby areas of the water  column and the water bottom", "430": "Dune Management Sand dunes are important shoreline features and are  an environmentally friendly form of shore protection.  In addition to serving as buffers against erosion and  flooding, which they do by trapping windblown sand,  storing excess beach sand, and protecting inland  areas against wave runup and overwash, they also  provide habitat for wildlife. Dunes, however, are  not permanent. So, to retain, enhance, or facilitate  the provision of their valuable services, they may  be restored or created in conjunction with a beach  nourishment project as discussed above or may be  managed as part of a separate effort. Since dunes and  beaches are interdependent, dune management should  be incorporated into a strategy that considers the  broader coastal system. Dune restoration is relatively inexpensive and entails  the use of dune grass and other types of native", "431": "vegetation and sand fences to capture shifting and  blowing sands and stabilize dunes. The use of  vegetation and sand fences to build and stabilize  dunes is not a quick fix, will only be effective under  certain conditions, and may not be effective as a way  of encouraging the growth of new dunes where  dunes did not exist in the past.  A number of other measures discussed in this guide  can be used to manage and protect dunes, vegetation,  and associated habitat, including laws and regulations  (e.g., zoning, buffers, setbacks, etc.) that restrict  development and other harmful activities (e.g., sand  mining, foot and vehicular traffic). To continue to  allow for public access, dune walkovers or fenced  pedestrian paths could be considered in planning and  project design", "432": "Sediment Management  Sediment management is an important aspect of  shoreline management and supports some of the  other measures discussed in this category and the  next. It requires an understanding of sedimentation  processes in the management area, recognizes  the importance of sand and other sediments  in protecting, maintaining, and restoring the  shoreline and its associated waters and ecosystems,  and incorporates activities affecting the erosion,  transport, deposition, and removal of sediment.  These activities include dredging and placing  sediment, building shore protection structures and  other structures that trap or divert sediment, and  mining.", "433": "Sediment management is best accomplished through  a regional effort involving all levels of government  and other stakeholders (coastal as well as inland) who  share an interest in a sediment system (i.e., a system  within which sediment exchange occurs naturally).  Regional sediment management includes the entire  environment, from the watershed to the sea; accounts  for the effect of human activities on sediment  erosion as well as its transport in streams, lakes, bays,  and oceans; and protects and enhances the nations  natural resources while balancing national security and  economic needs (Corps n.d.).  Any regional sediment management effort should  include an emphasis on the beneficial use of dredged  material. A sediment management program that  recognizes sediment as a valuable resource and links  needs with appropriate opportunities will be the most  effective at reducing economic and environmental  losses associated with climate change. Beneficial  use of dredged material involves using sediment  dredged from waterways for a productive purpose,  such as beach nourishment, habitat restoration and  development, public access facilities, and shore  protection structures (e.g., levees and dikes), among  other things.", "434": "Ecological Buffer Zones Ecological buffer zones (buffers) are similar to setbacks  (and may be included within setbacks), but are typically  designed to protect the natural, rather than the built,  environment. By protecting natural resources, buffers  protect the natural and beneficial functions those  resources provide. Protective services include providing  habitat and connectivity; minimizing erosion and  flooding by stabilizing soil, providing flood storage, and  reducing flood velocities; and improving water quality  through filtration of harmful sediment, pollutants, and  nutrients. Specifically, buffers are land use regulations designed  to reduce the impacts of land uses (e.g., development)  on natural resources by providing a transition zone  between a resource and human activities. Typically,  buffers are maintained in their natural vegetative  state and activities such as vegetation removal, soil", "435": "disturbance, and construction are restricted or  prohibited. As climate changes, buffers will also be  able to support inland wetland migration as well as  carbon sequestration. The effectiveness of any buffer will depend on  several factors, including size, elevation, vegetation,  slope, soil, permitted activities, adjacent land uses,  stormwater flow, and erosion rate. In addition,  effectiveness will also be dependent on property  owner compliance and the monitoring and  enforcement of buffer regulations. If drafting  new or revised buffer regulations, consider these  characteristics as well as how buffers, and the natural  resources they protect, might be affected by climate  change in the next century.", "436": "Open Space Preservation and Conservation There are a number of benefits to preserving open  space. Open spaces can improve the environment  and a communitys quality of life and contribute to  economic well-being. Specifically, open spaces:  Protect and provide habitat  Reduce flooding and stormwater runoff  Support water quality maintenance  Promote groundwater recharge  Provide opportunities for recreation  Enhance natural and cultural resources  Sequester carbon  Allow for evaporative cooling Open space preservation and conservation can be  accomplished through the management of lands  dedicated as open space through a number of the  measures previously discussed, such as zoning,  redevelopment restrictions, acquisition, easements,  setbacks, and buffers. While there are costs associated  with the management of open space, the public  expenditures may be lower than if the land was  developed and the provision of full services was  required. Management costs could be defrayed by  transferring the title to a nonprofit conservation  organization.

Although costly and complex,  if migration is constrained, wetland loss may be  compensated for through the creation of new  wetlands in suitable areas.  Steps that can be taken to facilitate wetland migration  include:  Prohibiting and removing shore protection  structures that would impede migration  Acquiring land suitable for migration through  easements or acquisition15  Requiring ecological buffer zones, setbacks,  and/or rolling easements  Adhering to the principles of compact  community design", "441": "Adopting policies that support these activities before  the suitable corridors are overly developed will likely  be more cost-effective and politically palatable than  once development has moved in.

While there is considerable scientific confidence in  support of activities that reduce nonclimate stressors,  the effectiveness of the measures discussed here in  helping systems adapt to climate change is not as  evident, and their consideration, while still essential,  requires a clear understanding of how a system  functions and how it might be affected by climate  change (CCSP 2008b).  These projects should be designed to withstand the  impacts of climate change, incorporating native  species that will be able to adapt to anticipated future  conditions. The focus should be on maintaining and  enhancing connectivity and preserving ecosystem  functionality and services rather than re-creating  a specific species composition.

Any project designed to restore, establish, or  enhance an ecosystem will require planning, long- term management, monitoring, and, possibly,  land acquisition. In general, of the three project types,  restoration is the most likely to be successful (Interagency  Workgroup on Wetland Restoration 2004). The outcomes  of projects that create new ecosystems or new ecosystem  services are more uncertain, especially when the additional  uncertainties of climate change are factored in. Wetland  creation is usually difficult and typically requires a lot more  planning and effort than restoration projects.

Reef restoration can help prevent further  degradation and facilitate the natural recovery process.  Future work on developing restoration strategies may  ultimately make reefs more resilient to the impacts of  climate change. To date, most restoration efforts have  been focused on repairing damage caused by human  impacts, such as vessel groundings and anchoring,  and these efforts serve to restore natural function,  structure, and diversity among injured reefs. Managers  have conducted pilot projects on applying restoration  techniques that may be used to respond to climatic  event disturbances, such as coral bleaching, and disease  mortality events. Coral reef restoration largely entails stabilizing  and repairing the damaged framework, recreating  topography, and transplanting corals dislodged,  propagated in nurseries, and/or relocated from other  suitable sources (e.g., corals orphaned as a result of  coastal construction projects).

This body of knowledge and these knowledge systems can be described as Traditional  or Indigenous knowledges. These knowledges refer to ways of knowing that can encompass culture, experiences,  resources, environment, and animal knowledge that are passed down generationally from elder to youth through oral  histories, stories, ceremonies, and land management practices.10 By providing observational evidence and informing the development of adaptation strategies that are culturally  appropriate, Traditional Knowledges (TKs) are essential to tribal understanding of climate change. Yet, TKs are eroding  as environmental changes and the timing of traditional ecological events become less reliable in determining the timing  and practice of traditional and cultural activities.11 The Guidelines for Considering Traditional Knowledges (TKs)  in Climate Change Initiatives refers to TKs as [I]ndigenous  communities ways of knowing that both guide and result  from their community members close relationships with  and responsibilities towards the landscapes, waterscapes,  plants, and animals that are vital to the flourishing of  [I]ndigenous culture.13 These traditional information  systems are held by tribal members and shared through  tribal community, cultural practices, oral history, as well  as direct family lineage, across multiple generations over  long periods of time. TKs encompass many aspects of  traditional practices and cultural information, not only but  including environmental knowledges. The term Traditional  Ecological Knowledge (TEK) refers to application and  utilization of these generationally based TKs with natural  resources on the landscape in management, collection,  ceremonial sustainability efforts, or reciprocity behaviors  and practices. TEK was first coined as the cumulative  body of knowledge, practice, and belief, evolving by  adaptive processes and handed down through generations  by cultural transmission, about the relationship of living  beings (including humans) with one another and with  their environment.14 This Guidebook recognizes that the  terms Traditional Knowledges and Traditional Ecological  Knowledge are defined and manifested differently among  different tribes and knowledge holders.", "470": "Throughout this Guidebook, the term TKs is used to include both environmentally focused and non-environmentally  focused TKs. Tribal community members, staff, and leadership in most cases have already noticed changes to the  environment or recent, novel extreme weather events. Other noted observations may include shifts in the patterns and/ or timing of important environmental events; and how drought, extreme heat, or heavy rainfall events may have affected  species, habitats, as well as community and cultural resources important to the tribe. These observations and relevant  TKs that support tribal culture and traditions can be identified and applied to climate change adaptation as appropriate.  Deciding how and where it is appropriate to incorporate TKs is a decision that can only come from each tribal  government and knowledge holder. A knowledge holder is most often a tribal member who has been imparted with and/ or actively participates in TK and/or TEK activities based on generations-worth of information.  When working with partners outside the tribe, sharing TKs requires approval from governing entities such as specific  committees and tribal leadership. Tribes maintain the right not to share TKs with external partners but could incorporate  those knowledges separately as part of their internal planning process. Tribes and knowledge holders have the right to  decline to share TKs and should only share TKs with free, prior, and informed consent.15 It is important to identify tribal policies concerning and addressing Tribal Intellectual Property Rights, which can  include oral traditional information, and understand the tribes legal processes for addressing the information, which is  sometimes prevented from general public release along with the legal restrictions of these tribal intellectual properties.  Using TKs in climate change planning can benefit the tribe, promote greater collaboration with partners, and improve  the outcomes of adaptation planning. Generational oral tradition information is not necessarily termed Traditional  Knowledges or Traditional Ecological Knowledges, but acknowledged as a traditional information system without  labels.

Though intended primarily for Western local  municipal governments, the guidebook has been used  around the world, including by Native American tribes.  There are several other adaptation guidebooks designed  to incorporate climate change adaptation planning  into: federal and state land management;22 conservation  planning for fish, wildlife, and habitats;23 and provide  local governments an adaptation framework.24 Still other  guidebooks are designed to empower communities to  plan for climate change.25 Most of these guidebooks are written from a perspective of Western Science and culture. While  valuable, these materials typically do not recognize the unique conditions of tribal governments and cultures.  At the same time, many tribes across the country have been leading exemplary efforts to address climate change (Table  1).

In addition, tribal council can  pass resolutions on climate change to demonstrate that the tribe supports and recognizes the importance of taking action  on climate change. Resolutions can also elevate the relative priority for adaptation planning within the tribe and across  the community. Some tribes choose to begin the adaptation planning process by reaching out to tribal leadership both  informally and formally. Others have tribal staff work directly on portions of the adaptation planning process and then  present those initial findings to tribal leadership later in the process.  Informal outreach to tribal leadership could include:   Inviting tribal council members to community outreach meetings; or  Engaging in initial conversations with department managers, tribal council members, elders, and other tribal  leadership to lay the foundation for the climate change adaptation planning effort. Formal outreach to tribal leadership could include:  Developing and proposing a draft climate change resolution to tribal leadership that affirms the need to address  climate change and potentially directs staff to work on climate adaptation (See Resources & Case Studies for a  template and examples);  Drafting and requesting approval for a letter of support from tribal leadership to include in grant applications;  Formally presenting to tribal council and/or tribal leadership on climate change and the need for adaptation  planning; or  Commenting at public and community meetings.", "508": "Why is climate change a concern for the tribe?

Methods that may be  successful in engaging tribal youth may not be appropriate for engaging tribal elders. Some examples include:  Sharing information in the tribal newsletter, on the tribes website, or on the radio (e.g., stories from elders or  other members of the climate change planning team, introduction to the adaptation planning process, a series on  the impacts of climate change, announcements for community focused events);  Posting flyers in high traffic areas (e.g., community gym, health centers, elder center, grocery store, gas station);  Tribal social media platforms (e.g., the tribes Facebook page);  Hosting a community town hall meeting (e.g., providing space for the community to come together, discuss  the tribes adaptation planning process, provide input, and learn about climate resilience, preferably hosted by  members of the climate change planning team and including food or snacks);  Distributing surveys (e.g., electronic and paper copies to the community to identify key concerns);  Visiting elders and listening the environmental changes they have observed (e.g., informal discussions);  Youth engagement (e.g., working with local schools, teachers, and students to engage tribal youth in the visioning  and planning process);  Silent voting (e.g., when requesting individual information in a group setting, community members may be  more likely to share information if it is not shared out loud.

Many tribes have high  internal staff capacity and technical expertise in the fields of natural resource management and scientific analysis.  However, funding for such positions are often from non-climate change-related grants, which limits their capacity to  devote time to climate change planning and analysis for the tribe.45 Other tribes have limited staff capacity for climate  change analyses.46 As such, many tribes have sought expertise from external partners (e.g., universities, federal agencies  and programs, private and non-profit organizations, and intertribal organizations) for training, data, and analysis to  support the tribes climate change adaptation planning efforts.47 It can be important to identify external partners who may have direct management of federal trust responsibilities  over the land and natural resources within the geographic areas of interest and those who could indirectly influence  management within the geographic areas of interest (e.g., federal agencies, state agencies, and regional planning  organizations).  Developing partnerships with external organizations can have benefits beyond the end of a specific climate adaptation  planning project. Collaborations with academic institutions, non-profit or private sector organizations, and federal  agencies can create avenues for lasting technical, communication, grant writing, implementation, or design support. Some  tribes work with neighboring jurisdictions (e.g., city, county, state, federal, private, and other tribes), particularly in the  cases of checkerboard tribes and tribes that have Usual & Accustomed areas that border or are on private or federal lands.

The  tribe may already incorporate TKs in tribal planning or policy activities, but may not refer to them as Traditional  Knowledges. Western Science uses terms such as Traditional Knowledges and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to describe how longstanding generational tribal knowledges are held, transferred, and applied within a tribe, and  when referring to Indigenous Science. These terms attempt to describe what tribes already do without the tribes labeling  it as such. Identifying where and how TKs and TEK are already being applied can serve as a base to build on within the  tribes climate change adaptation planning process.  Identify what TKs are already incorporated in the tribes planning process or management systems, that the tribe may not  describe as TKs, but may be relevant to this western definition. Consider looking for things that may not be called TKs  that the tribe already does and that contain a wealth of knowledge that can be useful for climate adaptation planning:  Identify TKs that are already collected or stored within the tribes cultural committee;  Identify information that may not have been used previously but could now be used (consider adaptations,  patterns, ceremonial adjustments, additional foods, etc.); and  Identify what TKs are being utilized in ways that are not articulated or written (maintenance, sustainability  practices, reciprocity rites, etc). These TKs can be applied throughout the adaptation planning process as appropriate to help identify concerns  (Section 2.2); gather evidence for observed changes (Section 2.3); conduct the vulnerability assessment (Step 3); gather  adaptation actions, set adaptation goals, prioritize actions (Step 4); and define and monitor success of actions (Step 5).", "519": "etermine Whether and How to Collect Additional Traditional Knowledges Consider whether the tribe needs or desires to collect additional TKs and what methods would be used.

Revisit Section 1.4 about considering opportunities and risks of incorporating TKs. Apply ways to reduce risks that  the tribe may already practice or may wish to incorporate further in their practices.

Acknowledging that  everything is important, it may be necessary to limit the scope of the adaptation planning process, at least initially, based  on available resources and tribal staff capacity. Over time and with additional resources, the scope may be expanded to  include all the potential concerns related to climate change and develop adaptation actions for every potential concern. Identifying concerns can be done using a variety of approaches with input from the community and the climate change  planning team.

For some tribes, the planning areas are  based around different topic areas or sectors (e.g. fisheries management, transportation, human health, and emergency  management). Other tribes have created planning areas around habitats (e.g., grouping all related species that are  concerns into that habitat) or by climate impact of concern (e.g., rising sea levels, wildfire risk, and extreme heat). There  may be a few concerns that do not neatly fit within a current department or existing program. Those can be considered  cross-cutting issues, requiring collaboration across departments or programs in order to accurately assess vulnerability  and develop effective adaptation actions. Table 6 lists planning areas defined by different tribes. Note: Upon organizing concerns into planning areas, it may become clear that there are gaps in the expertise of the  climate change planning team. This may be an opportunity to add a member with the appropriate expertise to the team  (Section 1.2) or consult with local or regional experts within the tribe or among external partners (Section 1.8).", "524": "Are there current management programs or plans that are already designed to work on or manage the identified  concerns?

There may also be thresholds that, if crossed, will have a  disproportionate impact. For example, warmer water temperatures can negatively affect salmon survival. Water  temperatures exceeding 15.5C [59.9F] increase the rate of disease and mortality among Chinook salmon.6 For each key concern, list climate variables that the concern is sensitive to, making note of particular thresholds.

Changes in the extent, magnitude, and frequency of  extreme weather events can have significant effects on the things the tribe cares about. Using existing resources  available for climate projections, it is possible to identify quantitative projections for many of these climate exposures.  Where quantitative projections are not available, exposure can be qualitatively assessed (i.e., identifying direction and  magnitude). See Section 2.4 for more guidance on collecting and summarizing relevant and actionable climate exposure  information. Sensitivitydepends on the nature of the key concern and the climate exposure variable. A particular concern may  be very sensitive to changes in water availability but only slightly sensitive to changes in temperature. For example, the  different tree species pinyon pine and douglas fir, which live near each other in dry coniferous forests, will likely be  exposed to the same increases in temperature and potential drought conditions. However, each species has a different  level of tolerance of drought conditions and thus can be more or less sensitive to those conditions.17 Similarly, due to  physiology, elders and youth are more sensitive to extreme heat events than young adults and adults.18  Adaptive Capacityof a key concern is critical in determining the impacts to climate and extreme weather events.  Identifying key limitations to adaptive capacity can help determine how to design and focus adaptation actions to  reduce those limitations and help the species, asset, or system respond positively to projected changes. For example, with  changing food supplies in a particular habitat, a generalist species that eats a variety of plants will likely have a higher  adaptive capacity than specialist species that relies on only one or two plants for survival. Similarly, a drinking water  supply system that has two water sources (groundwater and surface water) and two sets of pumps is better prepared to  shift between those sources if one source is affected by changing precipitation patterns (has higher adaptive capacity)  than a water supply system dependent on a single water source.  ", "544": "Determine Relative Vulnerability Rankings The tribe can use relative vulnerability rankings to help determine where to focus adaptation planning efforts.  Assigning sensitivity and adaptive capacity scores for the range of climate exposures can be used to calculate the relative  vulnerability of each of the key concerns. One way to do this is by using a relative vulnerability matrix.  High vulnerability key concerns (e.g., orange and red colors in Figure 10) that have higher sensitivities and lower  adaptive capacities. This means that those areas are likely to be affected first and worst by the changing climate  conditions.   Lower vulnerability key concerns (e.g., light and dark green colors in Figure 10) have lower sensitivity and higher  adaptive capacities. This means that those key concerns are not as likely to be affected, wont be affected  immediately, or may be areas of opportunity for the tribe in the future. For example, some species and resources  may actually do better with changing climate conditions, creating potential economic or other opportunities for  the tribe. There are a variety of approaches tribes have used to complete a relative vulnerability assessment process (See Section 3.1 and Section 3.2). A relative vulnerability matrix (Figure 10) such as the one used by the Jamestown SKlallam Tribe, can  summarize information that the tribe can use to focus planning efforts.  ", "545": "Sensitivity  Are there already existing climate or other stresses to the key concern?   What are some existing stressors that climate change could exacerbate?  How do current climate conditions and extreme weather affect the key concern?  What factors are the key concerns sensitive to and by how much?   What are the key concerns important climate and weather thresholds? Is there a maximum water temperature  above which a key fish species cannot survive? Is the species of concern currently located near the edge or lowest  elevation portion of its range? Is the infrastructure item or asset designed to operate in the projected range of  climate changes? Adaptive Capacity20  Is the key concern already able to accommodate or respond to current extremes? What about projected changes in  climate?  How easy or hard will it be for the system to adjust to the future changes? Why?   Are there alternative options (e.g., redundancy) for the key concern if one aspect of it is damaged?  Are there barriers to the systems ability to accommodate changes in climate (e.g., regulations based on historic  climate conditions; other competing uses of the system; high number of organizations involved in managing the  system; or biologic, geographic, or physical barriers)?  Will the rate of climate change be faster than the systems ability to adapt?  Are there other stresses on the planning area that will reduce its ability to adapt to climate change?  Does the tribe currently have the capacity to address the impact with minimal cost and disruption?", "546": "Complete a Qualitative or Quantitative Risk Assessment A risk assessment is the process of identifying the probability of occurrence multiplied by the magnitude of  consequences of an adverse event or impact. Using a risk assessment, or other approach, to assess the consequences of  changes in climate can help determine which issues will have the greatest impact on the community. Some tribes use  explicit consideration of risk to help determine where to focus their adaptation planning efforts. Others incorporate  consideration of risk into a multi-criteria assessment process. Either way, the goal is to use the information to determine  where to focus the tribes adaptation planning efforts.", "547": "Identify Priority Planning Areas The results of the risk assessment will guide the selection of priority planning areas. In some cases, these planning areas  may be pre-determined by the adaptation planning approach or may be further refinements of the initial planning areas  identified in Section 1.1. In other cases, they may be a subset of those initial areas focusing on the highest vulnerability,  highest risk, or near-term opportunities for action (depending on the criteria used in the assessment). This selection of  planning areas to focus on (or the refinement of key concerns to focus on within a planning area) can help target funding,  resources, and time on the areas where investment is most needed.", "548": "Collaborate with the appropriate members of the planning team, community, partners, and others in the assessment  process to determine the criteria for selecting planning areas to move forward into the planning for action phase. For  example, consider whether key concerns above a certain risk ranking (e.g., high risk) should be prioritized. Or, consider  whether low vulnerability or low consequence items would be best left for a future phase of the tribes adaptation  planning work. Narrowing the focus of the assessment will allow the tribe to use a finite set of resources effectively.", "549": "Who or what will be affected if a given impact occurs? How many people?

Would people be endangered, or merely  inconvenienced?   What are the cultural, social, environmental, and psychological effects associated with the key concern being  affected (e.g., mental health effects of losing homes, loss of income and employment from destruction of  businesses; how do decreases in species affect food availability, economic revenues, and tribal culture)?

Adaptation goals are general statements about what the tribe wants to accomplish in  a priority planning area. 1  The University of Washington Climate Impacts Group guidebook, Preparing for Climate  Change: A Guidebook for Local, Regional, and State Governments, recommends being specific about the timeframe for goals,  remembering the audience for goals, engaging others outside the planning team, and following guiding principles for  goal development.2  When setting adaptation goals, consult the tribes vision and overall goals for adaptation planning  (Section 1.3). Choose one or more goals for each planning area. For example, goals for coniferous forests could be to: 1)  decrease wildfire risk; 2) increase forests abilities to withstand drought; and 3) limit the extent and magnitude of pest  outbreak", "552": "Are there existing goals for each planning area?  How will climate change affect those goals? How do goals need to be modified to account for changing  conditions?   What is one (or more) overarching goal for each planning area related to climate change adaptation?", "553": "Identify Ongoing Actions Related to Adaptation The first place to look for ideas for adaptation actions is in the work that the tribe is already doing. Departments, agencies,  and other entities within the tribe may already be thinking about climate change. Identify any adaptation efforts in  existing tribal plans for natural resources, environmental, cultural, transportation, or other public service sectors. Work  already underway, or planned for, likely has the departmental and institutional support and funding to be carried out. It  may be a matter of slightly adjusting the inputs, targets, or scope of these efforts to ensure that they help the tribe prepare  for future climate.  ", "554": "Compile a List of Potential Adaptation Actions for Each Adaptation Goal The next set of places to look is to other tribes who have already completed adaptation plans, published and gray  literature, federal agencies or partnerships, Traditional Knowledges (TKs), or from the communitys own imagination.  These actions may need to be customized to align with the tribes priorities, TKs, and co-management responsibilities. For  example, an action from the US Forest Service Adaptation Resource that says: maintain or restore riparian areas by  promoting a diversity of tree and plant species to increase stream shading, provide a source of woody debris, stabilize the  soil, and provide habitat and connectivity for wildlife6  would ideally be modified to specify which types of trees to plant  and where to plant them.  Gather as many adaptation actions as possible from a variety of sources and then refine those actions, making them  relevant to the tribe. When gathering adaptation actions, consider actions within the categories defined in Table 9. Also,  the tribes staff, climate change planning team, and community members may come up with new possibilities. The  inclusion of TKs within this process has the potential to inform the development of adaptation actions that are better  connected to and support the tribes traditional practices and culture. Create a structure to organize the collected adaptation actions. It may be convenient to organize actions by planning area  and associated goals. Actions may also be organized by climate impacts or type of strategy or another method that works  for the tribe.

Start by deciding on a selection process and specific evaluation  criteria that the climate change planning team can use to prioritize adaptation actions. It is useful to have a mix of criteria  that represent a variety of factors that will ultimately determine the success of the actions. Criteria could include (but  are not limited to): effectiveness, cost (or cost/benefit), technical feasibility, political feasibility, cultural value, time frame,  flexibility, and others. The evaluation criteria can depend on available resources and the scope and vision of the present effort. For example, if  funding or time is limited, the selection process can simply be qualitative (i.e., high, medium, and low categories)  assessments, or the planning team can discuss and select actions, or vote on which actions to include in the plan.

There are multiple ways to do this. One way is to work through each action and assign a score  (e.g., 1 to 3, or 1 to 5) for each of the criterion for each adaptation action. Actions that score higher could be prioritized for  implementation. Note: Some categories, such as cost, may need to be scored in reverse (low cost = 3, high costs = 1) so that  the sum adequately helps prioritize lower costs actions if that is a goal for the tribe.  After evaluating adaptation actions using the selection  criteria, the planning team will decide how to rank the  actions. There are many ways to do this ranking. The  tribe could, for example, choose the top three adaptation  actions based on score, choose to pursue all actions that  exceed a minimum scoring threshold, or group actions  based on what can be done now or in the future (see call  out box). See Case Studies for additional examples. No matter what  approach is taken to evaluate and prioritize adaptation  actions, this is a great place in the process to set the  foundation for monitoring and evaluating (Step 5) the  success of those actions.

How will the actions be adaptively managed and allow for learning?", "566": "Create Implementation Plans for Prioritized Actions An implementation plan creates a road map for each action that can be followed one piece, one sector, or one department  at a time. Ask tribal staff members, community members, and other partners (if applicable) to review the adaptation  action text for their individual areas of expertise and ask them to add relevant context, set appropriate targets, and  highlight areas of overlap with other existing resources and projects. The implementation plan also creates a framework  to track the effectiveness of the selected actions and report to the tribe and other stakeholders. When creating an  implementation plan, consider, at a minimum, the following items:   Timeframe for action;  Lead (person, group, department, or agency);  Partnerships required (if necessary);  Funding required;  Indicators of success; and  Opportunities for mainstreaming with existing department responsibilities and actions.  Look for diverse and comprehensive funding sources that can support a wide range of actions, including infrastructure  and restoration (see Section 1.7). To the extent possible, identify when adaptation actions can be integrated into existing  departmental operations and management. Mainstreaming adaptation into ongoing efforts can be critical for securing  support and funding for implementing these actions. In addition, using an existing structure for tracking the success of  the actions makes monitoring and evaluation easier. The Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals highlights this in  their Adaptation Toolkit by saying that it is important to work with each department of the tribal government to integrate  the adaptation plan into ongoing planning and management activities of all tribal departments.

This may simply mean distilling technical reports into graphically  focused summary sheets that can be read by tribal members who do not have a technical background. It may mean  creating content for a weekly radio segment or posts in a tribal newsletter to share results or continue the resilience  dialogue in the community. Or, it may mean investing in the development of a video (or series of videos) that shares the  results of the tribes work and can reach an audience that would not be reached through reports or documents.

Consult Section 1.6 to find effective ways to engage and communicate with  different audiences within the tribal community. These outreach products can also be a great way to celebrate progress on adaptation.

One challenge is that rarely is it possible to move forward  with all of the priority actions (Section 4.4) at the same time. Consider starting with low or no-cost actions like outreach  and education; or focusing on a key window of opportunity (e.g., a grant-funded activity, an update to a management  plan) as this can be a good opportunity to begin implementing priority actions.  The climate change planning team has already helped identify actions relevant to their tribal departments. The key is to  start with a few small elements and move forward from planning to action. This will demonstrate tangible progress to  the community, tribal leadership, and potential funders, that can help create the momentum for tackling the harder, or  bigger, actions and changes identified in the plan. The plan itself can be used to support grant applications and justify  funding for implementing individual adaptation actions.  ", "573": "Consider Implementing a Pilot Project The planning team can consider implementing a pilot project (or a set of pilot projects) to test the effectiveness of priority  actions, and to decide how best to launch each adaptation action at scale. Pilot projects have the benefit of not being seen  as permanent and frequently face lower political and financial barriers. If successful, a pilot project (limited in extent or  geographic scope) can rapidly be scaled or rolled out to other areas. Pilot projects demonstrate measurable success and  can:  Help identify obstacles, logistical challenges, and possible unintended consequences in a semi-controlled, small- scale context;  Help determine if goals and timelines are appropriate and that the appropriate tracking, monitoring, and  reporting takes place;  Provide a forum for gathering feedback from tribal members, staff, and leadership that can be used to inform the  full-scale roll out of the action; and  Secure tribal and staff buy-in. A pilot project isnt always necessary. A full-scale launch may be appropriate where similar adaptation actions have  been previously executed under similar conditions (for example, by other tribes, or in areas with similar geography and  topography) with successful results. Full-scale implementation is also appropriate for smaller actions, or if an immediate  response to an urgent vulnerability is necessary.", "574": "What are the key near-term opportunities to integrate actions into ongoing activities or into management plan  development/update?

These indicators can be focused on specific individual  components of the process (e.g., number of people trained and workshops held) or specific outcomes (e.g., increased  awareness). Process indicators can be used to track progress in implementing action. Outcome indicators can be used  to track progress in reducing environmental risk and enhancing resilience. When developing both types of indicators,  consider the principles for developing good indicators of adaptation success (Table 11). Table 11 Principles for Developing Indicators of Adaptation Success. This table describes three principles and their rationales to  consider when developing indicators of success for adaptation actions. Principle Rationale Focusing on the Purpose Keeping in mind the communitys vision and guiding principles is important for  developing useful and relevant metrics of success. The metrics should:   Align with the tribal communitys vision and goals;  Keep the intended user of the information in mind;   Be assigned to a specific person or department;  Be relevant to any applicable decision-making processes within the tribe; and   Be shared broadly to keep the community engaged. Systems Thinking Everything is connected. Adaptation indicators need to take into account the larger systems  that affect adaptation outcomes. The measures should match the scale of the adaptation  action to the level of integration with other sectors. Creating a group of holistic and  balanced indicators can paint a more realistic picture. For example, consider:  Short- and long-term measures;   Small- and large-scale measures;   Objective and subjective measures; and  Indicators that track primary, secondary, and cascading impacts. Delivering Impact A good indicator will enable verification of the stated adaptation goals. Ensure validity,  where possible make them quantitative, and base them on performance and consequences. Source: Urban Sustainability Directors Network, Developing Urban Climate Adaptation Indicators (Urban Sustainability Directors  Network, 2017). There are multiple criteria for selecting indicators. See Case Studies and Resources for examples. Using measurable  indicators that can be objectively evaluated over time will help assess progress in implementing the adaptation actions.  Indicators can help simplify reporting on progress to tribal members, leadership, and other stakeholders. Consistent  reporting helps to generate additional interest, promote accountability, improve project management, and attract political  and financial support for the resilience building initiative. The tracking timeline will vary depending on the type of  adaptation actions selected. However, this stage is valuable whenever it occurs because it offers the opportunity for  reflection, revision, and improvemen", "576": "Commit to Monitoring Indicators Once the tribe has selected a set of indicators, develop an approach for tracking these indicators and progress in  implementing the adaptation actions overtime. Early planning helps ensure that systems are in place to collect  information throughout the implementation of the adaptation plan. Determining how well the actions are working is vital  for ensuring that the tribe meets the goals and objectives for the adaptation planning process.  Developing an efficient, consistent, and reliable approach for collecting and managing the indicators can include:  Identifying which members of the planning team will help with each of the tracking and reporting tasks;  Creating a schedule for collecting the information;  Deciding on the methods used to collect and document this information (if possible integrate information  collection into an existing process or standard operating procedure); and  Establishing how the information will be reported. Finally, the climate change planning committee does not have to disband upon the completion of the adaptation plan.  This group can be instrumental in implementing actions, monitoring the success of those actions, and continuing to  guide the tribes adaptation efforts.", "577": "What have other tribes and governmental or nonprofit entities done?

Vulnerable  communities experience heightened risk and increased sensitivity to climate  change and have less capacity and fewer resources to cope with, adapt to,  or recover from climate impacts. These disproportionate effects are caused by  physical (built and environmental), social, political, and/or economic factor(s),  which are exacerbated by climate impacts.

For example, if a wildfire damages a forest, the number of tourists may drop,  which may result in economic hardship for communities with tourist-based  economies and affect the well-being and adaptive capacity of people who own  and work at such businesses. A resilient population is not possible if the systems  that people depend on are not themselves resilient. Additionally, a regional  approach to climate adaptation can help ensure an efficient and effective  process that gets the greatest possible benefit from limited resources.", "638": " Future needs. Communities are constantly changing. As buildings are  constructed and torn down, people move in and out, businesses open and  close, and other systems in a community change, the resiliency needs of the  community change as well. For example, many older Americans want to stay  in their homes or communities rather than moving to retirement homes or June 2020 39 California Adaptation Planning Guide assisted care facilities, which creates a different set of resiliency needs. When  thinking about what resiliency means for the community, consider it from the  perspective of community members of all ages and future assets, not only  current ones. Additionally, some communities adopt ambitious housing plans  to help bridge severe gaps between community needs for affordable housing  options and current supply. These housing plans substantially influence the  resilience of precariously housed low-income households and individuals currently  experiencing homelessness due to lack of housing supply", "639": "COMMUNITY VISION FOR ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE A vision statement captures what  community members most value about  their community and what they want their  community to become. When drafting  a vision statement, it is helpful to think  about how the community will be similar  or different in the future (e.g., in 10, 20, 30,  or 50 years or more)how it will function,  what it will be known for, who will be  served by the community and its services,  what it will look like, what resources will be  needed, and more. Preparation of a vision statement should  be as inclusive as possible. Visioning is  often the first activity of a community  engagement process. The process can  include a variety of activities to engage  stakeholders in visioning. Ultimately, the  ideas and recommendations should be  compiled into a single draft vision that is  vetted through the adaptation planning  process. Goals should be statements of the desired  outcomes from the adaptation planning  process based on the vision of a resilient  community. A vision statement and goals  should reflect the needs, priorities, and  values of the community and of the  stakeholders involved in the planning  effort. Consider visions and goals that  help connect local adaptation planning  to State efforts, such as the ICARP vision and principles. Establishing goals early creates  a common foundation for the future work of everyone involved. Participants can refer  back to these goals throughout the planning process to help ensure that they are on the  right track. Later in the process, after preparing the vulnerability assessment, participants  prepare more-specific goals as a framework for the adaptation policies. Phase 3 of the  APG provides additional guidance for drafting goals.", "640": "HAT IS THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA? The participating jurisdictions usually  define the geographic area of the plan  or project. For example, a city conducting  adaptation planning efforts will focus on  building resiliency within its city limits or  sphere of influence. Similarly, a countys  efforts usually support adaptation  in unincorporated areas within its  boundaries. Regional governments may  also conduct adaptation work for all  jurisdictions in their area, and multiple  jurisdictions may collaborate on regional  adaptation work, creating a geographic  area that spans multiple jurisdictions.  However, sometimes the planning  area is not as clear cut as political  boundaries. Adaptation planning for  a natural resource or ecosystema  watershed, for examplemay need  to cover a broad area that does not  follow political boundaries. Even if the  planning effort is limited to a specific  area with defined boundaries (such  as a state park), natural areas outside  of these boundaries may need to be  included to the extent possible to help  ensure resiliency. Specific areas within a  community, such as neighborhoods or  defined frontline communities, may also be the focus of an adaptation planning effort.  Frontline communities are populations that experience the impacts of issues such  as environmental pollution, climate change, and the economic crisis first and most  severely. They are most often communities of color and/or low-income.4", "641": "WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS? Like all other planning efforts, adaptation planning requires time and effort. Local  government agency staff and other stakeholders will need to commit their time,  technical and financial resources, and the available knowledge of everyone involved  to ensure a successful process.  The time frame for the adaptation planning process may be determined by a grant,  budget cycle, direction from elected officials, community priorities, or other factors.  The breakdown of the adaptation planning process in Table 4 shows the phases and  steps in this guide and estimates the timing of each step. Steps may take more or  less time depending on capacity, funding, scope details, and other characteristics.  Following all phases could take 12 to 24 months, depending on the level of detail and  resources committed to each phase. It is also possible to work on more than one step  at the same time. Considerations that can affect the time frame of the process are:   Availability of local agency staff and other stakeholders who will lead and/or  participate in the planning process.  Need for external support from consultants, community partners, or other external  partners to complete the process.  Data availability from internal and external providers and whether any new  technical studies are needed.  Commitment to community and stakeholder engagement (beyond those who  are leading the process), including types and timing of events and opportunities.  As discussed in Step 1.4, providing opportunities for stakeholder engagement can  be critical to ensuring the success of an adaptation planning project.   Requirements for review and participation by external agencies. Some planning  mechanisms, such as general plan safety elements or local hazard mitigation  plans, require review by external agencies that can take many months", "642": "WHAT IS THE BUDGET FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS? The budget should consider the needs of each phase, inclusive of the financial  resources to support stakeholder engagement. Budgets should include labor costs to  complete the work in addition to other costs, including equipment, meeting supplies,  materials, production, transportation, training, facility rental, and food for meetings. In  some cases, adaptation planning may require minimal additional financial resources  if existing staff can do all the work; however, in most cases, additional expertise is  needed to conduct all or parts of the process. If existing staff lead a new adaptation  planning process, it is important to ensure key staff have dedicated time in their  workload over the time frame of the process. If a capacity assessment determines  that existing staff resources are not available to lead an adaptation planning process,  the budget may need to cover hiring additional staff or external consultants, or  developing partnerships with regional collaboratives, university partners, or other  community-based or nongovernmental organizations. An inclusive and equitable  adaptation planning process includes the participation of community members and  stakeholders, and the budget should encompass the financial needs of a robust  outreach and engagement process that values community-based contributions. After  estimating the budget, determine if existing general funds or other dedicated internal  funds are available; if not, identify options for grants or external funding sources or  partnerships. Communities may also be able to receive low-cost or free assistance  from experts working pro bono or from a local university", "643": "WHAT IS THE BUDGET FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS?

The climate adaptation planning team provides institutional and technical knowledge  and often supports stakeholder outreach and engagement. As with any project, the  team should include a mix of people from relevant agencies and organizations with  a range of skills and responsibilities, but it should not be so big that management  and coordination become difficult. The project team should have a primary point  of contact or team leader who coordinates the process and team meetings. The  team leader should be empowered to make recommendations and/or have direct  access to decision-makers. If resources allow, the project team can be supported by  an advisory group with a larger membership to include representatives of partner  agencies and community organizations that provide subject matter expertise and  credibility to the process. If a consultant team is hired to support the process, it should  be involved in the project team as well", "645": "A project team often includes members of other departments under the same  organization. For example, if the planning department of a city government conducts  the adaptation planning effort, consider including members of the public works, parks  and recreation, police, public health, and building departments. If special districts 50 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate within the project boundaries play important roles, such as a fire protection district,  school district, or water district, consider including a representative from these districts  on the project team. Given the scale, pace, complexity, and uncertainty of climate  change impacts, adaptation planning necessitates inclusive, collaborative planning.  Significant coordination across departments, particularly for larger jurisdictions,  should occur when assessing vulnerabilities and developing, vetting, and prioritizing  adaptation strategies. Such coordination will not only result in a more meaningful and  comprehensive adaptation plan but can also help build staff capacity and buy-in for  adaptation initiatives.", "646": "Community-based organizations and institutions, such as hospitals and colleges,  may be part of a core project team.

The easiest  way to start is to exclude climate change effects that are not expected in the defined  planning area. For example, a community in the high desert will probably not need to  include coastal hazards. With such a diverse environment throughout California, urban  and rural communities respectively face their own unique set of challenges due to  climate change. However, because climate change does not respect geographic boundaries,  hazards outside of a defined planning area may still be harmful to that planning June 2020 57 California Adaptation Planning Guide area. For instance, a wildfire can significantly impair regional air quality, block major  transportation routes, depress tourism, create refugees, and cause many other  impacts that extend beyond the burned area. Communities in the region may be  affected even if they have no wildfire-prone areas in their boundaries. It may be worth  including hazards that could affect areas of major regional employment or other large  economic drivers (such as state or national parks and forests), disrupt key infrastructure  (such as roads, rails, and power lines), or affect important resources that a community  relies on (such as snowpack that can affect water availability). If the adaptation planning effort is for a special district, such as a water provider  or park district, the number of climate changerelated effects may be smaller,  depending on the affected buildings, infrastructure, or resources. For example, ocean  acidification is likely not a hazard of concern for school districts, even those in coastal  communities.", "657": "WHAT ARE THE POPULATIONS AND ASSETS IN THE COMMUNITY? Climate change does not have the same effects in all parts of a community. Some  people and physical assets will be affected much more severely than others, and  adaptation planning efforts need to evaluate the full range of potential effects.  Communities should select the specific populations and assets to assess in order to  clearly understand how susceptible different people, places, and systems of the  community are to climate changerelated hazards and other effects. This allows 60 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate the community to develop adaptation  policies that respond to specific climate  vulnerabilities and build resiliency for the  most susceptible people and assets in the  community. Similar to identifying climate  change effects themselves, the goal here  is to compile a preliminary list of potential  populations and assets to help support  project scoping and the other steps of  this phase. The detailed vulnerability  assessment, including asset mapping, is  completed in Phase 2. What Is a Physical Asset? An asset is any feature of a  community that is not a person or  group of people. Assets include  the natural environment as well  as the built environment, such  as buildings and infrastructure  systems. Populations and assets are usually organized into a handful of categories or  sectors. For consistency with Safeguarding California and the California Adaptation  Clearinghouse, the APG organizes by 11 sectors:   Agriculture  Biodiversity and Habitat  Emergency Services  Energy  Forestry  Land Use and Community Development  Ocean and Coast Resources  Parks and Recreation   Public Health  Transportation  WaterJune 2020 61 California Adaptation Planning Guide Communities are free to use an organizing approach that better meets local needs.  For example, Placer County used the following categories in its adaptation planning  efforts for identifying populations and assets:7  Populations  Infrastructure  Buildings and Facilities  Economic Assets   Ecosystems  Services Regardless of how they are organized, virtually all people and assets in a community  will be affected by climate change in some way. However, it is not usually feasible to  assess the vulnerability of every population group or every asset in the community.  At the same time, adaptation planners should ensure that their assessment does  not exclude populations and assets that face greater harm or are critical to the  communitys well-being. When deciding which populations and assets to include,  consider these questions:  Is the population or asset likely to face substantive harm from climate-related  effects?  Is the population or asset likely susceptible to climate-related effects in a unique  way, different from most other populations or assets in the community?  If the population or asset is substantially harmed, are there significant  negative consequences to the community? Consider both direct and indirect  consequences and remember that consequences may not be evident until well  after the harm occurs.  Is the population or asset important to the community or other stakeholders?  Is the population or asset necessary to achieve overarching resiliency goals? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, the population or asset in question  should likely be included", "658": "People To help decide which groups of people to evaluate for climate-related susceptibility,  focus on populations who are likely to face the most harm from climate change. These  persons are sometimes said to be socially vulnerable or to have social vulnerability.  This does not mean that they lack resilient qualities. A person may be vulnerable to  climate-related consequences but have very strong social networks and community  involvement, which improve individual resiliency. It also does not mean that they are 62 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate responsible for their vulnerability or that they could have made different choices  that would have improved their resiliency. Many socially vulnerable people have  historically faced, and continue to face, systemic social, economic, and political  marginalization and injustice. By identifying groups that are socially vulnerable,  communities acknowledge the systemic discrimination that many such persons  have faced and seek to correct these wrongs and build resiliency in a manner that is  equitable and just. There are many reasons why some groups of people are more susceptible to climate- related hazardslimited access to financial resources, health challenges or disabilities  (physical, cognitive, behavioral, and all other forms), living or working conditions that  result in greater exposure to hazard events, physical or social isolation, historical and  current marginalization or deprivation of resources, and reduced agency or ability to  make decisions. These are all factors that can lead to a greater potential for harm,  and many people fall into more than one category. When selecting populations for an adaptation planning effort, consider the underlying  factors that contribute to a group being potentially susceptible. It may help to  combine populations that have similar root issues, are likely to face similar levels  of vulnerability and may benefit from similar adaptation solutions. For example, it  might make more sense for a community to assess low-income households (<80  percent of area median income), very low-income households (<50 percent), and  extremely low-income households (<30 percent) in one category. Other communities  might benefit from evaluating these three groups separately. A group of potentially  susceptible people should not be excluded simply because it represents a small  percentage of the total population. However, it may not be possible to accurately  assess the vulnerability of a very small number of people. If there are extremely  small groups who should be included in the adaptation planning efforts, consider  combining them with another group, as appropriate. Examples of potential populations to include are:8  Chronically ill persons, including those with compromised immune systems  Foster children  Incarcerated persons  Linguistically isolated persons  Low-income persons  Persons experiencing homelessness  Persons in designated disadvantaged communities  Persons in overcrowded households  Persons with disabilitiesJune 2020 63 California Adaptation Planning Guide  Persons without access to lifelines  Persons working outdoors, including farmworkers  Persons working in industries that may be subject to transition or elimination as a  result of climate change   Renters  Senior citizens, especially those living alone  Single female heads of households  Students  Tribal communities  Undocumented persons  Visitors and seasonal residents  Young children For more guidance on selecting populations for climate adaptation planning, and to  foster equity in implementation, see the Vulnerable Populations and Equity Checklist  appendices of Planning and Investing for a Resilient California and the ICARP guide,  Defining Vulnerable Communities in the Context of Climate Adaptation.", "659": "Built Assets There are many reasons to include built assets (buildings, infrastructure systems, developed  land uses, important economic drivers, etc.) in an adaptation planning effort. Some  built assets are used daily by a large percentage of the population and their damage  or loss would significantly disrupt community members. Some built assets provide  important services, such as delivering water or electricity. Some employ many people  in the community or attract large numbers of visitors, and the community would face  economic hardship if the asset had to limit its operations or close. Other built assets, such  as local landmarks or historically/culturally significant locations, may not provide tangible  benefits but are a source of community pride. Also, consider built assets not only for  their day-to-day performance, but for their value during or after a major emergency.  For example, people may not think of their local community hall or recreation center as  a critical asset, but during emergency events, these buildings can be assembly points,  shelters, and bases of operations for response and recovery operations.  When developing the individual categories of built assets, consider whether similar  assets should be grouped together or evaluated separately. It may make sense  to evaluate separately very important assets or those whose loss would be highly  disruptive. For example, communities can generally group roadways into one  category, but it may make sense to evaluate each major roadway or highway  individually. If a handful of similar built assets face different potential harms (for 64 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate example, multiple hospitals or wastewater treatment plants in different parts of the  community that are exposed to different climate-related hazards), it might also be  helpful to evaluate these separately. Consider whether it is helpful to evaluate the service a built asset provides separately  from the buildings or infrastructure that provide the service. Although they seem  related, the two could experience different degrees of vulnerability to natural hazards  and require different adaptation solutions. For example, a drought can significantly  affect water deliveries in the community, even if it causes no physical damage to the  water infrastructure. A hospital might survive a severe storm event with no damage or  loss of capacity, but emergency medical response service can be harmed by blocked  or damaged roadways. Examples of potential built asset categories are:  Airports  Bridges and tunnels  Communication systems and service  Community facilities (recreation centers, libraries, senior centers, etc.)  Power lines, natural gas pipes, water lines, and related services  Flood control infrastructure  Goods movement  Government offices and government continuity  Grocery stores  Major employers and economic sectors  Major roads and highways, especially evacuation routes  Medical facilities  Parks  Power plants  Public safety service  Rail lines  Schools, including colleges and universities  Transit stops", "660": "Natural and Managed Resource Assets These assets include natural ecosystems as well as assets that seem natural but are  closely controlled by humans, such as agricultural lands and managed timberlands.  They can include the land or water itself, the plant and animal communities that June 2020 65 California Adaptation Planning Guide live there, and less tangible benefits such as healthy biodiversity. Paleontological or  geological resources could also be included in this category, including those that are  extracted for economic benefits. There are many reasons to include natural and managed resource assets. First and  foremost, many of these assets are defining characteristics of the community and  the region and are considered invaluable to the people who live there. In a state  with such diverse and prized natural systems, natural and managed resource assets  can have tremendous symbolic value and be an enormous source of pride. In many  communities, these assets directly or indirectly employ large numbers of people  in recreation, tourist-serving activities, agriculture and food processing, and other  economic sectors. Natural and managed resource assets can also provide critical  ecosystem services, such as dunes and wetlands that help buffer coastal communities  from storm surges and high tides. Examples of potential natural and managed resource assets are:  Beaches  Chaparral  Endangered, threatened, and sensitive species  Farms, orchards, and vineyards  Forests  Greenbelts  Hiking and biking trails  Historic and cultural resource areas  Keystone species  Lakes and rivers  Livestock  Meadows and grasslands  Metal, stone, petroleum, and other extracted resources  Pastures  Scenic views or ridgelines  State and national parks, forests, wilderness areas, and other protected locations  Timber resources  Wetlands  Wildlife corridors", "661": "The APG recommends integrating  community outreach and engagement  into all phases of the adaptation planning  process. This will build trust between the  core planning team and community  stakeholders and develop a plan that  has collective support. Outreach and  engagement should be considered  carefully and budgeted appropriately.  The approach should include  stakeholders within the organization or  agency leading the adaptation planning  process, and those external to the  organization or agency.", "662": "Additionally, it is helpful if all members of the core planning team are trained in  outreach before engaging stakeholders. Topics such as cultural humility, racism, and  systems of injustice are issues that some may not be used to addressing in relation  to climate risk, but it is critical to understand those power dynamics when working  with vulnerable populations. For example, Figure 7 shows how populations deal with  underlying structural root causes, social factors, and biological factors that could  contribute to increased sensitivity to climate change. Understanding these causes  and factors before the outreach process helps create avenues of communication and  builds trust between the project team and the community", "663": "After assembling the core planning team, it is essential to enlist residents, businesses,  students, and other community groups because they have knowledge, information,  and ideas that local governments may not know or anticipate.

The plan can be simple, brief, and flexible to adapt over time. Ideally, as  noted in the Regional Resilience Toolkit, the outreach and engagement plan should:  Identify stakeholders (stakeholder mapping is one method).   Determine culturally specific outreach needs and strategies.  Link planning and outreach messages to community values and needs.  Develop outreach goals for each stakeholder group and the broader community.  Establish how to engage individuals and groups best and specify objectives and  roles.  Define the specific methods to most effectively engage each group: in a  meeting, via digital communications, one-on-one, or through partners or other  groups.  Detail how these activities will integrate with other planning efforts.  Determine need, objectives, and composition for an advisory group.  Determine the focus and purpose of each event, meeting, and input opportunity.  Provide a schedule with objectives and roles for each activity.14 The Regional Resilience Toolkit includes a sample outline for outreach and  engagement plan and tools and worksheets to support outreach tools, materials,  activities, and meetings.", "667": "PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  Local agencies can engage  with the business community to  support adaptation planning and  implementation. Protecting a healthy  local economy is a critical part of  maintaining a communitys long-term  resilience, and many businesses recognize  the threat that climate change may pose  to their activities and financial health.  Businesses also can provide increased  investments and other resources that may  not always be available to individual  communities. This creates opportunities  for businesses and local governments to  join or create public-private partnership  to address resilience issues. Opportunities  for public-private partnerships include  creating an economic working group  or advisory body, establishing training  and capacity-building opportunities  such as resilience or continuity planning  workshops, and setting adaptation  standards for permitting new private  developments. Communities can  join with local businesses as well as  larger companies that may be able  to meaningfully contribute to local  efforts. Local governments should  consider how best to use public-private  partnerships to support comprehensive  community adaptation efforts, because  businesses may be able to bolster resilience for other stakeholders and members of  the community. Local governments can consider how best to weigh the needs of  businesses along with the requirements of other community members.", "668": "STAKEHOLDER MAPPING  The engagement process should be inclusive and multidisciplinary. It should  include people at varying levels of authority, including those empowered to  make recommendations and decisions and representatives of governmental and  nongovernmental organizations. Stakeholder identification and mapping supports an  equitable outreach and engagement approach. Stakeholder mapping is the process  of visualizing relationships and prioritizing engagement efforts through understanding  perspectives and interests in the community. The Regional Resilience Toolkit includes  template worksheets to do this.16 For each stakeholder, the project team should  decide who should be involved; what their role will be in the process and the plan  implementation; and how, when, and how often they should be engaged (see  Figure 8). Furthermore, stakeholder mapping should list vulnerable populations to assess how  they will be involved. As mentioned in Step 1.3, vulnerable populations can include  chronically ill persons, foster children, incarcerated persons, linguistically isolated  persons, low-income persons, persons experiencing homelessness, persons in  designated disadvantaged communities, persons in overcrowded households, persons  with disabilities, persons without access to lifelines, renters, senior citizens, single female  heads of households, students, tribal communities, undocumented persons, visitors  and seasonal residents, and young children", "669": "CREATING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES Keeping stakeholder mapping in mind is important for each outreach and  engagement activity. Moreover, the core planning team should determine what they  are trying to achieve and help manage what the public should expect. It is helpful to  think of each outreach and engagement activity as part of a spectrum. See Table 7  for the International Association of Public Participation (IAP2) Spectrum.17, 18 The IAP2 spectrum is a theoretical model for varying levels of participation and  engagement and is not a specific recommendation for any one set of activities or  goals. Local agencies and communities need to decide what level of engagement is  appropriate to facilitate community participation in decision-making.  Core activities and characteristics necessary to building a diligent and robust public  engagement process include:  Providing educational opportunities.  Soliciting community input.  Maintaining a direct method of communication with the community specifically  for the climate adaptation planning effort.  Outreach can include, but is not limited to, meetings for specific topics or geographic  areas, online engagement, roundtables, forums, community festivals, workshops, or  pop-up events.", "670": "This guidance uses the latest and best available knowledge from state and federal  resources about designing and completing vulnerability studies.

Existing literature may also have  more information about general projected trendssuch as local LHMPs, previous local  or regional climate vulnerability assessments, the latest California Climate Assessment,  or resources in the Adaptation Clearinghouse. Projection data is also accessible through Cal-Adapt. Cal-Adapt and other sources  present a range of projection scenarios and climate models for different effects.  Considering a range of scenarios and models can help staff think through variations in  the severity of climate change effects and account for projection uncertainties. Data  outside of Cal-Adapt may be more helpful for some climate change effects, such  as information on heat-related public health rates, which can be accessed from the  California Heat Assessment Tool (CHAT).", "678": "SELECTING CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTION PARAMETERS Cal-Adapt and other resources provide climate projections for an array of greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions scenarios, climate models, and time frames.

GHG emissions scenarios reflect different projections  for how global emissions and atmospheric GHG concentrations may change over  time. The latest scenarios are representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and  Cal-Adapt provides projections for a low emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) and a high  emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). The Governors Office of Planning and Research (OPR)  recommends that agencies use RCP 8.5 for analyses considering impacts through  2050 because there are minimal differences between emissions scenarios during  the first half of the century.1  For analyses considering impacts beyond 2050, OPR  recommends selecting warming scenarios on a case-by-case basis. For a more  conservative approach to a given community element, consider using only RCP 8.5.  For a less conservative approach, use both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Which approach  will be most useful in selecting emissions scenarios depends on a given community  elements risk and criticality. ", "680": "Selecting climate models. For each GHG emissions scenario, retrieve projections from  a range of global climate models (GCMs), which vary based on the different modeling  assumptions. The most current GCMs come from the Coupled Model Intercomparison  Project, version 5 (CMIP-5), developed to support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change. Though using all 32 CMIP 5 GCMs is ideal for a comprehensive assessment,  there are subsets of 10 and 4 GCMs that closely simulate Californias climate and can  be used in studies that cannot accommodate all 32 models.2, 3  Cal-Adapts default  settings provide outputs for these subsets of 10 and 4 models, depending on the hazard.4 Considering a range of climate model outputsin addition to an ensemble average can be helpful in getting a fuller picture of potential future conditions. State guidance,  including from the Safeguarding California Plan and the California Ocean Protection  Council, recommends evaluating a range of future climate scenarios appropriate for  planning decisions and respective risk aversion level. For example, high-end scenarios  (e.g., H++ scenario for sea-level rise) are recommended for use with high-stakes decisions  where underaccounting for projected changes could lead to significant financial or  environmental impacts or public health and safety consequences. It is also important to retrieve climate projections for the appropriate time frame. After  selecting the historical baseline and future time horizon of interest, pull climate data  for a multi-decade period (usually 20 or 30 years) centered on the year of interest. For  example, if the year of interest is 2050, consider pulling projections for 2040 to 2060 or  2036 to 2065. Cal-Adapt uses 1961 to 1990 as the default baseline period; 1986 to 2005  is another common baseline period. Multidecade averages account for interannual  variability and appropriately characterize the climate norm for the selected historical  context and future time horizon.5", "681": "TEP 2.1D: MAP HAZARDS AND OTHER CLIMATE CHANGERELATED EFFECTS Mapping climate projection data helps with visualizing the populations and assets  that are projected to be exposed to the effects of climate change. Depending on a  communitys needs and staff capacity, some mapping options are printed maps, free  computer mapping tools like Google Maps, or dedicated Geographic Information  Systems (GIS). In cases where mapping is not particularly informative, other methods for visualizing  climate trends can be relevant to a community. For example, consider projecting  the frequency of heat waves (i.e., multiple extreme heat days over a given threshold)  over the Step 2.1c time horizons, and see how this frequency changes over time.  Cal-Adapt includes a variety of visualizations to inform an exposure analysis and has  downloadable data to allow visualizations in other software (e.g., Excel charts). In some cases, quantitative datasets are not available for relevant hazards. In this case,  it is still useful to provide a narrative description of how (and whether) exposure varies  across the community, and the degree to which community assets are projected to  be exposed. For example, although there are spatial datasets showing todays inland  flooding and landslide risks, there are not widely available spatial datasets related to  future inland flooding and landslide risks. For these hazards, it is still useful to explain  how risks may change in the future due to changes in climate. Accessing Climate Hazard Projection Data with Cal-Adapt Cal-Adapt is an online resource that provides quick and easy access to  downscaled climate project data. An array of climate models and emissions  scenarios offer climate projections for the major stressors facing California,  including: Temperature averages and extremes Precipitation averages and extremes Sea-level rise Wildfires Drought Cal-Adapt provides users with easily accessible projections and more detailed  downloadable data to support a range of needs.88 Phase 2: Assess Vulnerability For more detailed mapping, GIS data sources for climate hazard projections include:  Coastal hazards. Sea the Future is a good resource for understanding the various  sea level rise and flood visualization tools available. While there are a number  of options, all with their own benefits and limitations, organizations may wish to  consider two in particular. The US Geological Surveys Coastal Storm Modeling  System (CoSMoS) has maps of coastal flooding under various sea level rise  scenarios, storm conditions, and erosion. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the  Adapting to Rising Tides (ART) program has detailed sea level rise mapping for  several different scenarios. Unlike other sea level rise mapping programs, CoSMoS  and ART programs provide both sea level rise and coastal storm scenarios on  a simple online platform without the need for specialized software. Both also  provide detailed information that is not always available from other mapping  sources.  Temperature, precipitation, hydrologic variables, and wildfires. Cal-Adapts  downloadable data is available in NetCDF, TIFF, and other formats. If the planning team has GIS capabilities, it can overlay these climate change effect  projections with community assets. Consider mapping climate change effects with  utility assets, transportation assets, hospitals, telecommunication assets, public spaces,  populations, and other assets. Another option is to map climate change effects with  indices of social vulnerabilitysuch as CalEnviroScreen and Healthy Places Indexto  learn more about projected exposure in disadvantaged communities", "682": "Step 2.2: Sensitivity and Potential Impacts The goal of Step 2.2 is to characterize  past and potential future climate impacts  to community populations and assets.

However, examining  historical climate impacts is useful  for establishing context and better  understanding present-day vulnerability.  As a result, in this step, consider both  historical and projected impacts by  collecting information on past impacts  and augmenting this with more forward- looking information. Specifically: 1. Conduct desk research on historical  climate impacts.  2. Conduct desk research on potential future climate impacts.  3.

A set of adaptation and resilience goals, policies, and objectives based on  the information identified in the vulnerability assessment for the protection  of the community. A set of feasible implementation measures designed to carry out the goals,  policies, and objectives including, but not limited to, all of the following:   Feasible methods to avoid or minimize climate change impacts  associated with new uses of land.   The location, when feasible, of new essential public facilities outside of at- risk areas, including, but not limited to, hospitals and health care facilities,  emergency shelters, emergency command centers, and emergency  communications facilities, or identifying construction methods or other  methods to minimize damage if these facilities are located in at-risk areas.

Natural infrastructure means the preservation or restoration of ecological  systems, or utilization of engineered systems that use ecological processes,  to increase resiliency to climate change, manage other environmental  hazards, or both. This may include, but is not limited to, flood plain and  wetlands restoration or preservation, combining levees with restored natural  systems to reduce flood risk, and urban tree planting to mitigate high heat  days.", "707": "Step 3.1: Summarize Vulnerability A helpful first step in developing the framework is to review the results of the  vulnerability assessment, focusing on the major climate vulnerabilities identified in  Step 2.4. The Regional Resilience Toolkit recommends summarizing the vulnerability  assessment in problem statements that describe the vulnerability and its  consequences.1  The purpose of the problem statements is to provide concise,  plain-English descriptions of the climate vulnerabilities so that all stakeholders,  decision-makers, and members of the planning team understand the nature of  the challenge. This will aid in assessing how well the community is prepared to  deal with the problem now (adaptive capacity) and aid in developing new policy  and strategies. Underlying data and analysis should also be preserved and made  available, but the problem statements allow everyone to work from a basic, common  understanding.", "708": "After completing the assessment of climate changerelated effects, summarize the  findings to identify the most significant potential for harm in the community. These  findings or problem statements will help to craft effective strategies and actions.  Problem statements will help to:  Communicate critical planning issues, for example, which critical assets are  particularly vulnerable, what areas currently have repetitive losses, or how many  high hazard areas are currently zoned for future development.  Assist the community and stakeholders to prioritize and focus on the areas that  have the greatest need for mitigation or adaptation based on the assessment of  climate changerelated effects.  Create a clear and cogent story to help support decision-making by elected  officials and other stakeholders.  Provide a foundation for seeking funds to reduce the potential for harm and  increase community resilience.", "709": "CONFIRM VISION The objective of this step is to confirm the communitys vision for adaptation and  resilience. It should engage stakeholders, the project team, and decision makers.  Phase 1 included preparation of a vision or definition of what adaptation and  resilience means to the community. In Phase 3, a review of the vision will help frame  how to address the issues in the vulnerability assessment. If the community did not  prepare a vision statement during Phase 1, this is a good time to do so.", "710": "RAFT GOALS Goals provide direction for achieving a vision and act as guideposts throughout the  planning process and implementation. As noted in the Regional Resilience Toolkit, 2 establishing resilience goals assists in:  Building transparency into the process at the outset so that all participants  understand the breadth of priorities and topics to cover.  Engaging the project team and stakeholders early in deciding what shared  outcomes they will work cooperatively to achieve and providing an opportunity  for input and feedback on the project direction.  Providing a foundation upon which future project decisions can be made and  help in evaluating how well mitigation actions will meet established community  values and expectations.  Connecting to metrics and tracking and monitoring progress of the project  through implementation.110 Phase 3: Define Adaptation Framework and Strategies Goals may be driven by a desire to protect:3  Physical areas (e.g., new development along the shoreline, natural resource areas  or assets)  Asset classes (e.g., infrastructure, natural resources)  Social values (e.g., protecting parks because beauty and recreation are highly  held values)  Economic values (e.g., protecting major economic drivers like large businesses)  Character, history, sense of place (e.g., protecting historic structures or  neighborhoods)  Existing functions/activities (e.g., emergency services)  Specific communities (e.g., vulnerable populations) To get started, group the problem statements from Step 3.1 by themes, such as climate  change effects, populations and assets at risk, or sectors. Several problem statements  or groups may lead to a single adaptation goal. The APG uses 11 sectors (see Figure 4)  to support organization of example strategies, which are defined in Appendix A.  Communities can use the same sectors or follow an organizational approach that best  fits their implementation needs. When drafting goals, it is important to start with a review of existing goals in the  communitys planning documentse.g., general plan and LHMPand state plans  such as Safeguarding California and the State Hazard Mitigation Plan. This review  will help the project team determine if existing community goals support the vision,  respond to the vulnerability assessment and will support integration and alignment of  adaptation and resilience goals. Goals that respond to the vulnerability assessment, such as those that seek to increase  adaptive capacity, protect assets, and reduce impacts from hazards and other  climate change effects, help other stakeholders see how resilience fits with existing  community priorities. Goals should be clear and accessible to all stakeholders, and  they should reduce or avoid long-term vulnerabilities. The goals will be supported by  strategies developed in Step 3.3.  The General Plan Guidelines (2017) define a goal as a general direction-setter. It is  an ideal future end related to the public health, safety, or general welfare. A goal is a  general expression of community values and may be abstract in nature. It may not be  quantifiable or time dependent.4 The FEMA Local Mitigation Handbook describes goals as general guidelines that  explain what the community wants to achieve with the plan. They are usually broad, June 2020 111 California Adaptation Planning Guide policy-type statements that are long term, and they represent visions for reducing or  avoiding losses from the identified hazards.5 Goals should be designed with consideration to how progress can be tracked or  monitored. Some communities may prepare one or more objective statement for  each goal. These objective statements are meant to be specifically measurable  in some way that shows progress toward the goal. For example, a goal to reduce  community vulnerability to wildfires might have objectives for the percentage of  homes that meet defensible space best practices. Whether specific objective  statements are prepared or not, the goal and strategy development process should  proceed with consideration to developing specific indicators of progress that can be  monitored", "711": "Strategy development is iterative, especially in an inclusive and transparent  process with the community.

In this step the project team should prioritize  those adaptation strategies. This will aid in making decisions about complex issues,  and it will make the strategy development process transparent and easier to  communicate to community staff and residents. Prioritization of strategies should  consider several factors:  Vulnerability Score (from Step 2.4). Which strategies will be effective at addressing  assets or systems with the highest vulnerability?  Administrative Operability. Who will implement the strategy and what is their  organizational capacity?  Cost. How much will the strategy cost to implement?  Funding. What resources are available to pay for implementation?  Bond funding. (e.g., LA Countys Measure W, California Prop 68), tax programs  (e.g., Bay Areas Measure AA, tax-increment financing), public-private  partnerships, and others as summarized in Phase 4.  Effectiveness/Benefit. How effective is the strategy at addressing the problem  and/or what is the benefit? What future losses might be avoided?  Efficiency. How do the costs compare to the effectiveness/benefit? (What is  the benefit-cost ratio?) What are direct and additional indirect benefits of the  strategy?  Co-benefits. What are the co-benefits of the strategy?  Environmental Performance. What are the potential environmental impacts or  considerations of implementing the strategy? Does the strategy support nature- based approaches and natural systems?  Equity. Who pays the cost and who receives the benefits (including co-benefits)?  Legality. Is the strategy consistent with applicable laws?  Responsiveness/Appropriateness. How responsive or appropriate is the strategy to  the needs and conditions of everyone in the community, especially those on the  frontline?  Timing. When will implementation begin and how long will it take?  Monitoring. How will the strategy be tracked and monitored for effectiveness? Is  there a key performance indicator?", "718": "Cost/Benefit Assessment for Adaptation Actions The two resources below illustrate ways in which communities can assess  and balance the benefits associated with adaptation actions and the costs.  Balancing these is critical to communities to achieve the most effective and  implementable outcomes. Using a NOAA framework, the San Diego Regional Climate Collaborative  compared the trade-offs (cost vs. benefits) of various coastal adaptation  strategies. This assessment evaluated the utility of the NOAA Framework  and demonstrated the outcomes for two southern California cities. The  outcomes balanced costs of the strategies against the potential losses  associated with various scenarios.19 In Economic Analysis of Nature-Based Adaptation to Climate Change:  Ventura County, California, the Nature Conservancy assessed the potential  costs and benefits of engineered measures (coastal armoring) compared  to nature-based adaptation measures. The Nature Conservancys  publication summarizes the evaluation methods and the findings as an  example to other jurisdictions. This type of analysis gives a community  insight into the reasoning behind actions to address sea level rise.20", "719": "The Regional Resilience Toolkit suggests looking at four frames when prioritizing  strategies:21  Society and equity.

Phase 1 also presented the types of plans, programs,  and implementation mechanisms common in adaptation planning. In Phase 3, the  project team developed and prioritized adaptation strategies. Development of June 2020 137 California Adaptation Planning Guide adaptation strategies likely included identification of a potential lead department  and/or partners tasked to implement a strategy, a time frame for implementation, and  potential cost estimates. When starting Phase 4 and implementation, the first step is to  prepare an implementation program and to confirm the implementation mechanism  and responsible department of entity needed for each adaptation strategy. Some  strategies will be implemented upon adoption of the plan prepared as a result of the  adaptation planning process, while others will need to be further developed and/or  be integrated into other plans or programs. All adaptation strategies have temporal components that include time to implementation,  timing of necessary action, and duration of effectiveness. These elements of time must be  considered for all strategies and when devising the method of measure delivery. For implementation strategies that will be further developed or implemented, the  team should identify the planning document or other mechanism best suited to drive  strategy implementation, as well as any documents that should be amended to ensure  consistency. The answers to two questions can help clarify the choice of mechanism: 1. Which mechanism most closely overlaps the intent and topic area of a strategy? 2. Which mechanism is next slated for update or revision?", "724": "Regardless of how they are implemented, adaptation strategies tend to be in more than  one plan, such as the general plan, local hazard mitigation plan (LHMP), climate action or  sustainability plan, integrated regional water management plan, and capital investment  plan. Other possible mechanisms for adaptation strategies are discussed in Phase 1.  General plans. In 2017, OPR released updated General Plan Guidelines. These  guidelines are a resource for understanding where climate adaptation strategies  are best integrated into a general plan. Climate adaptation influences content  in all chapters of a general plan; however, the element that often holds the most  adaptation content is the safety or comparable element. Other elements of the  general plan, including optional elements such as an equitable and resilient  communities element, may also have adaptation content.1   The safety element is the primary location for addressing climate-exacerbated  hazards and climate change impacts. This includes identifying community  vulnerabilities associated with climate change (see the vulnerability assessment  described in Phase 2) and developing strategies to address these vulnerabilities  (Phase 3). The safety element should include a vulnerability assessment or a  reference to where it is in another document. This element in particular must  be consistent with the LHMP if the community has one. It also needs to be  consistent with other elements of the general plan, such as land use, circulation,  housing, conservation, air quality, and environmental justice.138 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust   The land use element includes  the planned future pattern of all  community land uses and can  include policy language that  reduces the vulnerability of existing  and new development.   A circulation element can include  policies ensuring appropriate  ingress and egress for all  neighborhoods and that major  circulation corridors are not  endangered by climate impacts  and addressing other mobility- related vulnerabilities.   Housing element policies ensure  that all residential land use by  type, location, and building  standards are resilient to heat,  poor air quality, and all other  potential climate impacts. These  policies can also address the  availability of housing and the  vulnerabilities of persons who are  susceptible to climate change due  to their living situation. The California Department of Housing and Community  Development (HCD) has an abundance of technical assistance available to  local governments.   The conservation and open space elements include strategies to protect  vulnerable ecosystems (habitat, sensitive and endangered species, other  flora and fauna). They may also include policies to reduce vulnerabilities from  hazards in natural areas (e.g., fire).   The air quality element can address vulnerabilities from climate-influenced  pollutants. For example, this optional element could address vulnerabilities  from increased ozone due to warmer temperatures, and issues from increased  particulate matter associated with drought or fire.   The environmental justice element or content can specifically acknowledge  that some subpopulations in a community are disproportionately vulnerable to  climate impacts, particularly with respect to health outcomes. This element or  content area relates to many other elements in the general plan. City of Hermosa Beach  General Plan and  Climate Change The City of Hermosa Beach  General Plan, adopted in 2017,  has a section in the safety  element focused on climate  change impacts and adaptation.  This section addresses sea level  rise, extreme heat, and other  potential impacts, such as public  health, precipitation, water,  biological resources, agriculture,  marine resources, and energy. The  plan includes potential impacts  of projected climate change  and strategies to ensure the city is  prepared for them. 2June 2020 139 California Adaptation Planning Guide  Local hazard mitigation plans. LHMPs  include both long-term and short-term  hazard mitigation planning. They can  include discussion of emergency  preparation and response, such as  notification systems and available  resources for emergency response  activities. These plans also should  ensure that communities are  prepared for escalating climate  vulnerabilities. The LHMP should be  consistent with a communitys general  plan safety element.  Climate action plans/sustainability  plans. Climate action plans (CAPs)  or sustainability plans are broad  strategic plans to address climate  change or sustainability. They do  not have a standard structure or  form, unlike other mechanisms such  as general plans. Climate change  adaptation is often a component,  although some may focus only on  greenhouse gas reductions. They  may include or refer to a vulnerability  assessment (Phase 2). Some of their  strategies often overlap with the  general plan, LHMP, and other plans  such as a bike and pedestrian plan.  Many CAPs and related documents  discuss implementation issues,  including assigning responsible  entities, funding, and indicators for  monitoring.", "725": "Integrated regional water management plans. Integrated regional water  management (IRWM) plans address water concerns at a regional level. SB 1672 (2002)  requires IRWM plans that address water supply and quality, flood protection, and other  matters. The California Department of Water Resources IRWM planning guidelines  require the inclusion of climate change considerations in IRWM planning analyses.  In an effort to assist practitioners, the Department of Water Resources developed a  listing of climate change documents relevant to IRWM planning. The regional-level  assessment, oversight, and strategies can deliver higher value investments and balance  priorities among multiple jurisdictions. This is particularly important in settings such as  the California Delta Ecosystem or the Salton Sea, where watershed issues fall under the  authority of several local, regional, and state agencies.  Capital improvement planning. A local governments capital improvement plan  is an annual or biennial plan for financing community projects and is typically  what funds community assets or infrastructure, such as bridges, water treatment  facilities, or community centers and smaller projects such as new bike lanes or  sidewalks. These projects may be directly vulnerable to climate hazards, may  serve as shelters or gathering places or may provide evacuation routes during  emergency situations. Having local community facilities and infrastructure that  are climate resilient bolsters local adaptive capacity. In addition, integrating  adaptation into the planning and design efforts for public projects nearly always  saves a community money through avoided losses, even if the up-front costs of a  new location or additional structural measures are slightly higher.5 Climate-resilient  features may also reduce regular maintenance and operation costs of some  facilities (such as rooftop solar panels).  ", "726": "Adaptation strategies, regardless of the plan or program that contains them, need  to be implemented to achieve their intended outcome. This requires assigning  staff, developing programs or other measures, securing funding, and engaging the  public. Many of these choices are described in Phase 3. It is important to confirm the  remaining details to implement the strategy. This process builds on the prioritization  of adaptation needs and strategies in previous phases, and outreach and funding  are covered in subsequent sections. The way to implement adaptation actions will  vary by location and jurisdictional context. Things to consider when developing the  implementation approach are:6, 7  Build on existing processes. Building on actions already proven effective in a  community is a great place to start. Ideally, pursuit of this concept began in  Phase 3, but further implementation includes integrating strategies into programs  already in place from another plan, such as the general plan or LHMP. Bolstering  or altering existing programs builds on internal strengths. Staff may already be June 2020 141 California Adaptation Planning Guide familiar with a particular type of  policy or program, cutting down  on training, the startup time, and  associated costs.  Assess cost-effectiveness. The  project team should evaluate each  implementation method for cost,  down to the department and staffing  requirements. This process also begins  in earlier phases, such as Phase 3, but  has a role here. In situations where  multiple implementation options can  achieve the same adaptation goal,  cost/benefit assessment is a way to  compare measures to determine  the most cost-effective option or a  sequence of measures that starts  with the most fiscally feasible but  potentially lower adaptation benefit  in the short term. At its simplest, such  an assessment looks at whether  or not an action can be funded  on an ongoing basis through the  general fund. This case can be  bolstered in when implementation  yields future cost savings, offsetting  the implementation cost. Strategies  such as altering the building code  for cooler (lighter color) roofs is an  example that does not impose  high costs directly on the local  government. Other actions may be  funded with establishment of a new  fee system. Larger, structural projects  are often funded through bonds.  The measures that are more difficult  to implement rely most on external  funding or financing. In many cases,  this is the most feasible option, but  also the most tenuous.  City of Chula Vista Cost  Effective Measures  Chula Vista, through use of the  Climate Change Working Group  (CCWG), adopted adaptation  actions in 2011. The CCWG was  made up of residents, businesses,  and community representatives.  In collaboration with city staff, this  group brainstormed a lengthy list  of potential measures, which it  ultimately trimmed to 11 based on  factors such as local jurisdictional  authority and cost considerations.  These considerations resulted  in nearly all of the 11 actions  being implemented. One such  success was cool roofs. The  CCWG recommended and city  staff implemented a new cool  roof ordinance. The measure  was estimated to cost less than  $30,000, an amount deemed  feasible for the city budget.8, 9142 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust  Leverage community and  private sector alliances. Aligning  strategies with local community  groups and private sector entities  is a good way to ensure ongoing  effectiveness. It also is a way to  limit cost burden by delegating  aspects of implementation to an  external entity. This can be formally  established with an MOU or a similar  formal partnership agreement. The  following section describes outreach  specifically, a critical part of ensuring  that adaptation benefits are shared  in all parts of a community and that  the actions bolster social equity.  Establish partnerships regionally. Geographic boundaries should  not constrain adaptive actions,  and some adaptive actions require  regional collaboration. Regional  compacts or less formal partnerships  with regional entities can assist  communities with technical  assistance and potential funding.  Regional partnerships also are a  good way to engage in peer-to-peer  learning with communities that share  similar challenges. The Alliance of  Regional Collaboratives for Climate  Adaptation provides the context  for many parts of the state to foster  learning, allow for collaborative  pursuit of funding opportunities, and  develop private sector adaptation  support. 10", "727": "IMPLEMENTATION OUTREACH When the adaptation planning is complete and the plan is approved, the transition  to implementation can be celebrated with a fun, public event. Such an event is an  opportunity to honor stakeholders and their role in the process and is the next step  of implementation. The event should be planned with those already engaged in the  process, but this is also an opportunity to identify stakeholders that have not been  involved and could be important voices and partners during implementation. This  includes communities most likely impacted by one or more points of vulnerability or  affected by the strategies that have been prioritized for implementation. Implementation strategies can and should build on the actions recommended in  Phase 3. In this case, rather than asking community members to help brainstorm  adaptation measures, community members can be asked for help supporting and  bolstering implementation and supporting monitoring. During engagement, the  project team can share ongoing progress of adaptation actions and their resulting  benefits. Communities can be sought in the following roles:  Collaborators in education.  Participants and facilitators of tours of adaptation projects as they are implemented.  Recipients of surveys to assess effectiveness and social acceptance.  Receptors or generators of online updates of adaptation progress.  Participants or leaders of pop-up booths at locations illustrating adaptive action  or community events.  Communities can ensure ongoing support for adaptation by maintaining outreach  efforts. Climate adaptation requires ongoing, long-term commitment despite the  changes in elected leaders. When people are informed about and involved in  adaptation strategy development, implementation, and monitoring, they are more  likely to call on local leadership to continue support for that. In the best cases, local  agency staff and local organizations are partners during the implementation process", "728": "MPLEMENTATION FUNDING Strategies must be funded regardless of how they are implemented, or the planning  mechanisms used. Funding and financing sources can include local general funds,  bonds, taxes, assessments, fees, grants, private sector partnerships or investments,  non-profit grants and partnerships, among others. The state has many grant programs  to support location adaptation actions funded through cap-and-trade. The  Adaptation Clearinghouses Investing in Adaptation web page lists many funding  opportunities by adaptation sector and has guidance on conducting fiscal analyses of  adaptation strategies.14 It is regularly updated as funding sources evolve. The California  State Library also lists funding opportunities resulting from recent legislation.15 Climate  Adaptation Finance and Investment in California also has guidance on funding  adaptation measures intended for local government staff. The Regional Resilience  Toolkit includes steps for identifying and gathering adaptation funding sources.16 Some  federal sources, such as FEMAs Hazard Mitigation Grant Funding (HMGP) and Building  Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) programs can be used to fund and  finance adaptation actions. Many communities across California have historically used  federal funding for these activities. Non-profit funding sources may also be available. Local agencies often rely on their general fund for partial or full funding of  implementation since they control it and using it does not rely on local ability to  receive grant funding or raise new capital. However, local agencies often have limited  general funds and competing needs for its use. City of Oakland Community-Based Climate Adaptation  Planning The Pacific Institute report conducted in collaboration with OCAC,  Community-Based Climate Adaptation Planning: Case Study of Oakland,  California, identifies methods of engaging frontline communities in the  implementation processfrom the way that climate change is discussed to  the methods that communities use to participate in implementation.13 Two of  these methods are: 1) an appointed task force of stakeholders from throughout  the community who make recommendations about implementation, and 2)  a community-initiated coalition, that is, a coalition of community groups who  make recommendations collaboratively.June 2020 145 California Adaptation Planning Guide In cases where a community does not have general funds, staff, or other funding  resources to implement all adaptation strategies, it can be helpful to rank strategies  by how important it is to enhancing climate resilience and by the local capacity to  fiscally support implementation (refer to Task 1.2). Strategies can be classified based  on whether current support of a strategy would require 1) no budget adjustment, 2)  reallocation of funds, or 3) new and/or external funding.", "729": "OPRs Climate Adaptation Finance and Investment in California includes a chapter on  funding and financing implementation with guidance for local governments regarding  options for bonds and taxes. It also includes grant programs by sector. It is intended to  provide a survey of issues, considerations and sources of funding that can help guide  strategies and tactics for investing in adaptation and resilience in California.20 In times of economic downturn or limited local budget, collaboration with regional  partners can result in joint planning and resource sharing activities, as well as  cooperative purchasing agreements to support implementation. The Alliance  of Regional Collaboratives for Climate Adaptation (ARCCA) provides ways for  communities in many parts of the state to collaborate, limit costs, and achieve  effective adaptation measure development and implementation. AECOM partnered with Resources Legacy Fund to produce Paying for Climate  Adaptation in California: A Primer for Practitioners, a report that synthesizes information  local decision-makers need when thinking about funding and financing climate  adaptation. The report offers a foundational understanding of existing constraints June 2020 147 California Adaptation Planning Guide and opportunities and recommends ways cities, counties, water districts, utilities, state  agencies, private companies, and other entities can make adaptation and resilience  investments.21 The AECOM report categorizes funding opportunities into:  Grants and assessments. Grants, such as planning grants that help fund  acceleration of affordable housing production and streamline housing approvals,  can be obtained for entities at all levels of government, and assessments rely on  property owner. Both of these require high local capacity.  Taxes. Taxes primarily require payment by property owners. Different taxes are  subject to various rules and requirements but may be a good option for certain  adaptation strategies.  Fees. Fees rely on users to generate the funds to support adaptive measure  implementation. In many cases, there are strict rules regarding where such funds  may be spent.  Private involvement. There are a variety of ways in which the private sector can  be involved; however, there is less consistency between examples save for a  common private investment for public benefit. Resources such as Blue Forest Conservations Forest Resilience Bond, the CECs  Characterizing Uncertain Sea Level Rise Projections to Support Investment Decisions,  Finance Guide for Resilient By Design,22 Transit Resiliency Funding Opportunities,23 and others all provide guidance, suggestions, and ideas to guide funding to support  adaptation strategy implementation. Funding is a dynamic component of adaptation  planning. Many of the foundational funding sources are familiar, such as general  funds; others, such as new grant programs or green bond financing, emerge on  an ongoing basis. Many of the websites and resources summarized in this section,  particularly from the State of California, such as the Adaptation Clearinghouse, allow  communities to track the emergence of these resources.", "730": "In cases where an adaptation strategy requires construction of a physical asset  typically included in a capital investment plan, the asset can be included in the  annual or biennial planning process, which are better equipped for financing larger  projects. An effective way to support implementationwhether using the capital  investment plan or local general fundis to demonstrate the fiscal benefits from  loss avoidance and improved public safety. It is almost always less costly to address  climate impacts or hazards ahead of time rather than responding after they happen.", "731": "Step 4.2: Monitor Climate conditions continually change, as do science, community characteristics,  regulations, technology, and other factors that affect adaptation needs. Monitoring  is critical to ensure that the chosen strategies to address community vulnerability  continue to be as effective as planned. For each adaptation strategy, one  department should be designated as the responsible agency for carrying out  monitoring activities, including storing monitoring data. In many cases, this also  requires designation of a dedicated funding source for monitoring activities. The  responsible agency can be a jurisdictional department, regional entity such as a  council of governments, or a community group. If a community group, a specific  memorandum of understanding should be established between a jurisdictional  department or regional entity and the community group to ensure ongoing data  collection and data quality. There should also be a designated department that  gathers and compiles all the monitoring data from all the monitoring entities to  conduct an overall assessment of effectiveness. Monitoring is the easiest and most cost-effective when using an indicator that is  already collected as part of day-to-day operations. During strategy development  and prioritization (Phase 3), the indicator to be monitored should be identified. It  should reflect the impact being addressed, the desired outcome, and the specifics  of the individual strategy. Identified indicators should be collected at a prespecified  intervalat least annually, although more frequent collection rates may be necessary  (such as event frequency or tide height). Example indicators include signals of the  impact being addressed, such as beach width, mean high tide, flood frequency and  peak flow, or fire frequency and intensity; the desired outcomes, such as asthma rates,  days missed from work or school, air quality, or climate hazard losses; and specifics  of the strategy, such as structural condition of mitigation or days and frequency of  closure or service disruption (roads or other assets).", "732": "MONITORING AND OUTREACH The results of monitoring efforts should  be reported regularly to the public to  maintain awareness of effectiveness and  local adaptation needs. Communities  can publish a regular adaptation report  to the public, place the information on  an interactive website that is regularly  updated, or report the results through  other means. The cities of Encinitas,  Burlingame, and Richmond all provide  examples of municipal efforts for  communicating implementation progress.  This type of transparency is critical to  keeping the community engaged in the  ongoing challenge of adaptation. In  particular, this data should be available  and communicated to community  members who are expected to be most  susceptible to climate-related issues.  Some sample actions are:  Document lessons learned during the planning process and ensure that future  planning processes take the lessons into consideration.  Have a community advisory board lead monitoring and review of the plan, or  partner with a university or college program to do this.   Identify mechanisms for holding agencies and departments accountable.   Use open data online platform approaches to sharing climate, project  implementation, and equity information with community members.", "733": "MONITORING AND OUTREACH The results of monitoring efforts should  be reported regularly to the public to  maintain awareness of effectiveness and  local adaptation needs.

Monitoring is the first step in adjusting to these changes. The monitoring  data should be analyzed and evaluated to identify if and how a strategy no longer  meets community needs. This evaluation should focus on what the community sees as  the goal of the adaptation strategy, so that effectiveness can be assessed based on  community need. When a strategy is identified as losing effectiveness, a series of steps  are needed to plot a path forward. State legislation may also trigger a re-evaluation  of the vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies. When a strategy loses effectiveness, the vulnerability and susceptibility of the people,  resources, assets, or operations it affects should be reassessed. It is most practical to  keep the focus of the reassessment as narrow as possiblea new, comprehensive  vulnerability assessment is not always necessary. When updating a vulnerability  assessmentwhether individual scores or the entire analysisthe first priority is  to review any scientific updates and changes to community characteristics. The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change updates its periodic summary of climate  science and global adaptive needs every five to seven years.27 The state issues an  updated Safeguarding California Plan periodically with updated science and state  conditions, and conducts a new Climate Change Assessment every few years.28 There  are also many regional assessments emerging from universities and regional agencies  or nongovernmental entities. All these reports may have updated science and other  useful information.  Another source for new or improved data is datasets or studies prepared in the  aftermath of climate-exacerbated hazards, such as fire or flooding. These resources  often combine local social conditions and context with bio-geophysical factors that  contributed to the experienced hazard event. As community planners know, community characteristics change over time. When an  adaptation strategy loses effectiveness, it is critical to assess whether or not changes  in the community have altered the experienced climate change effects, increased  the vulnerability of any populations or assets, or made any additional community  members or assets susceptible. For example, if a growing community has increased its  level of development and associated impervious surfaces, it may have also increased  its flood risk. The community should assess if the escalating risk disproportionately  affects any specific populations or locations. County health departments are a key  community ally in identifying changes to the population characteristics and to overall  health indicators.", "735": "EVALUATION AND OUTREACH Community outreach and education programs about evaluation can be a very  effective way to engage community members in efforts to shift course in adaptation  strategies. Include the public by, at a minimum, disclosing evaluation outcomes  transparently. This leads to a better understanding of the finite nature of any  single adaptation strategy. It is also possible to include community organizations  or committees in the assessment and evaluation of monitoring data. More direct  participation fosters better understanding across more of the community, and it should  include disproportionately affected or frontline communities in these efforts. Some  sample actions are:  Define and regularly measure a series of equity-related indicators.  Develop a reporting system (e.g., online) to communicate results for the equity- related indicators through time.  Ensure clear avenues for recourse and accountability of project implementation.", "736": "EVALUATION AND OUTREACH Community outreach and education programs about evaluation can be a very  effective way to engage community members in efforts to shift course in adaptation  strategies.

Each strategy should be evaluated carefully to assess  the extent to which it can be bolstered to address increasing impacts of climate  change and the extent to which it precludes strategies that may more effectively  address the impacts. Such assessments should take place during the first couple  of years of implementation of any strategy so that potential strengthening and  compatibility with other strategies are known from the outset, making for smoother  adjustments based on indicator evaluation. For example, strengthening a sea wall or  flood wall may make retreat or accommodation strategies more difficult to pursue;  however, in many cases, initially bolstering a physical barrier can give a community  time to set up strategies that accommodate higher sea or flood levels. Once those are  in place, the physical barrier should give way to the accommodation strategy (see  Table 13). Evaluation of monitoring data can help communities determine when such  transitions should take place. Strengthening a strategy varies widely by strategy, from changing the speed of  implementation, to altering its location, to revising the implementation mechanism.  The changes to strengthen a strategy should be identified as part of the initial  implementation, and the indicator being monitored should be tied to pre-identified  points where strengthening may be required. 152 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust As well as evaluating strategies for the extent to which they can be strengthened, they  should be evaluated for their compatibility with potentially more effective strategies.  In many cases the strategies that are potentially more effective take longer or cost  more to implement, making them better suited to be a longer-term strategy that can  be implemented after priority strategies are put into effect. Choosing when to shift to  the longer-term strategy is more easily managed when specific triggers for the shift are  identified ahead of time (see Table 13). Table 13.

At Crescent City, for example, along  the northern California coast, the local NOAA tide  gauge records show a drop in sea level of two  inches, or 0.65 mm/yr since 1933 when the gauge  was first installed (Figure 2.3). The northern Cali- fornia and southern Oregon coasts are both being  uplifted due to tectonic activity, which proceeds  in those locations today at a rate greater than the  rate of global sea level rise. However, the far north  coast is the only place along Californias shoreline  where sea level is currently dropping relative to  the land surface.", "751": "Beginning in 1992, several satellites have been  launched with the capability of measuring the  level of the ocean from space very accurately. The  18 years of data that have been collected to date  are free of the effects of vertical land movements that can affect tide gauge measurements. They indicate that the global rate of sea level rise has  increased to a little over three millimeters per year  between 1993 and 2010 (Figure 2.4).  Recent research and climate change analysis in- dicate that the rate of sea level rise will likely ac- celerate during the coming decades as ocean wa- ter continues to warm and expand and as the ice  sheets and glaciers of Greenland and West Antarc- tica break up more rapidly than were previously  anticipated. ", "752": "Sea level rise has been taking place since the end  of the last Ice Age, about 20,000 years ago. Al- though global sea level rise has been fairly grad- ual, coastal California has noticeably experienced  its effects for at least the past century. According to the 2009 California Climate Adaptation Strat- egy, sea level has risen by an average of about 7  inches along Californias 1100-mile coastline during  this period, contributing to progressive shoreline  retreat and coastal cliff, bluff and dune erosion.", "753": "By the year 2100, mean sea level may rise by as  much as 40 to 55 inches (1 to 1.4 meters) along  the coast of California, although these projections  are being modified as observations continue to be made and additional data become available. The  California Ocean Protection Council, working with  the Coast and Ocean Climate Action Team (CO- CAT), which consists of representatives from 15  different state agencies, have adopted interim sea level rise projections for the decades ahead using  the high scenarios in all cases for 2030, 2050, 2070  and 2100 (Table 2.1).  Rates of sea level rise are region-specific because long-term land motion influences sea level at any individual location. In California, sea level has been  measured historically at 14 different tide gauge stations between San Diego and Crescent City, al- though two of these stations were discontinued  during the 1990s (Table 2.2). Eight of the stations  have at least 50 years of data, and the oldest sta- tion at San Francisco has been in operation since  1857 (Table 2.2)", "754": "Local sea level rise rates at 10 of the 12 stations  covering the 800 miles from San Diego to Point  Reyes vary surprising little, from 3.1 to 8.3 inches  per century (or 0.75 to 2.10 millimeters per year).  There are significant year-to-year variations. A close look at the San Francisco tide gauge at Fort  Point, near the Golden Gate Bridge, for example,  reveals the clear signature of large El Nio events  that have affected the coastline at various points in the past century (Figure 2.5). Sea levels along  the entire California coast have been elevated for  months at a time during these events. During the large El Nio event of 1983, high water  level at the Golden Gate Bridge reached 8.87 ft, or  1.77 ft higher than predicted, the highest in over a  century of record keeping. Sea levels in Los Ange- les that year were also the highest in sixty years of  tide gauge history, (7.96 ft, or 1.06 ft above pre- dicted), as they were in San Diego (8.35 ft, which is  0.95 ft above predicted, the highest in the 77-year  history of that station). In addition to these ex- treme tides, the 1997-98 El Nio also was accom- panied by sustained periods of elevated sea levels.  The following chapters will discuss the importance  of these short-term events to coastal flooding and Table 2.2. Historic Sea-Level Rise Rates from Tide Gauges along the California Coast.

At  Humboldt Bays North Spit, sea level is rising by  18.6 inches per century (4.73 millimeters per year),  the highest rate in California (Figure 2.6). Just 80  miles north at Crescent City, sea level is dropping  relative to the coastline by 2.5 inches per century  (0.65 millimeters per year) (Figure 2.6). The shore- line at Humboldt Bay is subsiding, whereas Cres- cent Citys coastline is rising.", "756": "A vulnerability assessment is the first step in the process of developing an informed sea level rise  adaptation plan (Figure 3.1). Assessing a commu- nitys vulnerability to sea level rise needs to con- sider three factors: 1] the probable magnitude of  sea level rise and its associated impacts; 2] the  sensitivity or exposure of the planning area to  sea level rise and future storm and wave impacts; Page 11 and 3] the ability of the community to adapt or re- spond to the anticipated impacts. A vulnerability assessment should include an  evaluation of the degree of a communitys expo- sure to various shoreline hazards as well as the  magnitude of the impact in the case of a signifi- cant event, such as a large El Nio storm or storm  surge that elevates sea level significantly. In turn, adaptation is the adjustment of natural or human  systems to actual or expected phenomena or their  effects, such that it minimizes damage or harm. A coastal communitys adaptive capacity is defined by its ability to respond to sea level rise and oth- er coastal hazards. This includes the reduction or  moderation of potential damages and coping with  their expected or predicted consequences", "757": "One approach for conducting a coastal haz- ards vulnerability assessment is to form a  Sea Level Rise/Coastal Hazard Preparedness Team  (abbreviated the Team), which can be a formal or  informal group. The quality, value and acceptance  of any adaptation plan ultimately depends upon  the involvement and buy-in of the directors of the  public agencies that stand to be affected by sea level rise and associated impacts.

A more efficient and effective approach for sea level rise planning is to utilize a consultant or consulting firm work- ing with a small group of key city or county agency  staff. A carefully selected consultant or consulting firm should have expertise and experience in the rel- evant issues (climate change and sea level rise,  coastal processes and hazards, for example), a  strong track record of working successfully with  coastal communities, and the time necessary for  completing the entire planning process within a  finite period. In this case, the Team may consist of the consultant and several key local govern- ment department staff, using other staff members as resources for providing input and information  about specific issues, reviewing draft documents and assisting with the editing and preparation of  a final plan. Local ownership of the final adapta- tion plan is important and a good reason for on- going involvement of the local government staff. It is easier to put a consultants report on a shelf  and forget about it, in contrast to ignoring what a  group of city or county staff people worked hard on, come to believe in, and are passionate about.

There are two components  of sea level that are important to any individual city  or county: 1] the extreme sea levels or tidal eleva- tions that have been recorded in the past, and will  likely occur in the future, 2] the long-term rate at  which relative sea level is rising in your region.  The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Ad- ministration (NOAA) provides current information  about regional sea level, both extreme historic lev- els and also trends in sea level rise that come from  its tide gauges. These combine data about ocean  level fluctuations and vertical land motion at a number of locations along Californias coastline. An  important consideration in the use of these data is  the time period covered by the closest gauge(s) to  a particular community. The time period should be  long enough (ideally 30-40 years or more) to distin- guish short-term and decadal variations from long- term trends.

Collect all Information on Communitys Historical Vulnerability to Coastal Hazards ful. Some of the most convincing evidence of the  threats posed by future sea level rise and coastal  storms are written accounts, maps of affected or damaged areas, or photographs of past events.  Such records make it clear that these events have  occurred in the past and will occur again, although  most likely with greater frequency and intensity.  Appendix B includes a listing of all of the major El  Nio events to impact the California coast from  1912 - 1994 (Storlazzi & Griggs, 2000). This is a  good starting point for checking on historical re- cords or specific dates in newspaper archives to see what local impacts or damages may have re- sulted from these events. Task B. Obtain Sea Level Information While sporting goods store or surf shop tide tables  provide reasonable estimates of the expected el- evations of the high and low tides each day, up to  a year in advance, a number of oceanographic or  meteorological processes can raise regional sea  level significantly above the predicted tidal eleva- tions. El Nios, low atmospheric pressure, strong  storms and large waves can all raise sea level above  predicted elevations for hours to weeks (Figures  2.5 and 3.2). A subsequent section on Temporary  Increases in Sea Level During El Nio Events or  Storms will explain this in more detail.  Over at least the next 30 to 40 years, it is these  short-term events that will likely present the great- est flooding and inundation hazards to coastal communities, rather than the more gradual long- term rise in sea level. The NOAA website for each  tide gauge or water level recorder will contain  information on the extremes recorded each year  and how much they exceeded the predicted high  tides at those sites.  The historic record of sea level change for each  station can serve as useful minimum baselines  or starting points for projecting future sea level", "770": "changes. Unfortunately, not every coastal commu- nity has its own tide gauge, and some historic re- cords are relatively short.

Much of this area, however, is sparsely populated;  development, with the exception of Crescent City  and the Humboldt Bay area, is usually well above  sea level on uplifted marine terraces.", "771": "Although predicting the future always involves  uncertainty, a community will nevertheless  need to consider the potential for future accel- erated rise in global sea level to affect local sea level trends. Many climate scientists and research  groups around the world have been working on  improving methods and models for estimating  future global sea level rise based on a range of  greenhouse gas emission scenarios and therefore,  future atmospheric and ocean temperatures.  The continued warming of the atmosphere and  oceans, as well as the continued retreat of moun- tain glaciers and melting of ice caps and shelves  of Greenland and Antarctica, are all parts of the  equation. Depending upon their responses to con- tinued warming, they will affect sea level globally. The California Ocean Protection Council and State  agencies have adopted future sea level projec- tions (Table 2.1). The various projections or models  for future sea level rise produce similar results for  2030 (5 to 8 inches of global sea level rise), with  increasing differences by 2050 (10-17 inches) and considerable divergence by 2100, (ranging from 31  to 69 inches, or 2.5 to nearly 6 feet) (Figure 3.3)  This increasing divergence of values as we go fur- ther into the future is common with any extrapo- lation or projection, simply because of the uncer- tainties in both natural processes as well as human  behavior and government decisions. exposure to sea level rise), is whether it may be  advisable to work with NOAA to have a tide gauge  installed in the community in order to begin to  monitor sea level and how it is changing over time.  Komar et al. (2011) recently completed an as- sessment of sea level variations along the Pacific Northwest coast from Humboldt Bay in northern  California to Neah Bay on the Olympic Peninsula  in Washington. They relate differences in sea lev- el records to changing climate and differences in land motion, whether uplift or subsidence. For the  northern California coast, this work provides some  regional perspective about how the elevation of  the coastline has changed over time and, there- fore, how local sea level rise has been affected. Determining Most Appropriate Tidal Gauge Data For the many coastal communities that do not  have local tide gauges, it will be necessary to  determine which is the closest and most appro- priate station to use. Overall, the differences in the rates of sea level rise along Californias entire  coastline for the past 50 to 100 years are quite  small, however. The range of rates that have been  recorded at 10 of the 12 stations, covering the  800 miles from San Diego to Point Reyes, range  from 3.1 to 8.3 inches/century (0.75 to 2.10 mm/ yr) (Table 3.1 and Figure 2.6). Therefore, for most  communities, using rates of sea level rise from the  closest station or stations, at least for the next 25  to 50 years, does not present major concerns. One  additional consideration (depending upon a com- munitys distance from a NOAA tide gauge and its  Chapter3 Conducting a Sea Level Rise and Coastal Hazards Vulnerability Assessment The National Research Councils study is evaluat- ing all of the factors that are expected to affect future sea level rise along the States coastline and  is developing up-to-date projections based on the  best available information and science.

Most of the ma- jor historic storm damage to Californias coastline  has occurred during El Nio storms, which were  especially devastating during 1982-83 and 1997-98  (Figures 3.4 and 3.5).  Sea levels along the states coastline often rise sub- stantially, ~12 inches or more (albeit temporarily),  during El Nios, when the Eastern Pacific Ocean is warmer than usual and westerly wind patterns  are strengthened. The 1982-83 and 1997-98 El Nio  events caused hundreds of millions of dollars in  storm damage to private and public property as  well as infrastructure, due to the combination of  temporarily elevated sea levels and large storm  waves, which in 1983 repeatedly coincided with  high tides (Figure 3.6 and Figure 3.7; Griggs and  Brown, 1998; Griggs, et al. 2005). In late January 1983, sea levels were the highest  that had ever been recorded in San Diego, Los An- geles and San Francisco, at 9.6, 12.2 and 18.7 inches  above the predicted high tide levels, respectively.

When evaluating the possible consequences of  global sea level rise for their community, a Team  could handle the future uncertainty by perform- ing a sea level rise hazards assessment by using a  few different projected future sea level rise sce- narios and different time frames.

Long-term wave data from buoys located  off of the coasts of California, Oregon and Wash- ington provide evidence of increasing offshore wave heights (Ruggiero, et al, 2010). While it is not  yet certain whether these increased wave heights  are related to warming of the oceans, there is a  high probability that these phenomena are relat- ed. The causes for increased wave heights are not  agreed upon yet, but they might include changes  in storm tracks, higher wind speeds, increasingly  intense winter storms, or other factors. During the 22-year period from 1980 to 2002, the  average wave height increased by 1.5 feet along  Figure 3.8. Inundation of East Cliff Drive at Twin Lakes State Beach in Santa Cruz during elevated sea levels, high tides and storm waves in February 1998 (Photo: David Revell). the central California coast (Storlazzi and Wing- field, 2005). It is also important to keep in mind that these wave heights are based on the 22-year  record between 1980 and 2002 but the trend is for  increasing heights, so these values may continue  to increase over time. Seymour (2011) summarized evidence for changes  in the Northeast Pacific wave climate by analyzing the number of occurrences of waves with average  heights that were greater than 20 feet (6 meters).  He divided the data into two 12-year periods (1984- 1995 and 1996-2007) and found that for the area  from Pt. Conception to the Oregon border, there  is a substantial increase in the number of occur- rences of these large waves between the first and the second time periods (Figure 3.9).", "778": "Most communities along the California coast  were negatively affected by three El Nio winters: 1978, 1983 and 1997-98. There are state- wide inventories of both impacts and damage  (California Coastal Commission, 1978; Domurat,  1978; Swisher, 1983; Griggs and Johnson, 1983;  Seymour, 1998; Storlazzi and Griggs, 1998).

Conception to the Mexican bor- der) are less pronounced than they are along the  central and northern California coastline. In the  1984 to 1995 period, there were 7 storm events  with waves 16 feet or higher and 4 events that re- sulted in wave heights of 20 feet or higher. Dur- ing the 1996 to 2010 period, however, there were  69 events that resulted in wave heights of 16 feet  or greater and 10 events that resulted in wave  heights of 20 feet or greater (Figure 3.10). Coastal storms are expected to continue to in- crease in frequency and intensity during the com- ing decades (Barnard, et al, 2011). When increas- ingly large waves are combined with a gradually  rising sea level, we can expect an increase in the  frequency of the flooding of low-lying areas (Fig- ure 3.11) and an increased risk and rate of coastal  cliff retreat. Although wave characteristics may change in unknown ways in the future, their pat- terns over the past several decades have been  well documented.  The effects of storm waves upon the coast are not new to California, which has been battered fre- quently during the recent past (Figures. 3.12 and  3.13). Rather, these effects are likely to be exacer- bated by rising sea levels.", "780": "The next step in assessing a communitys vul- nerability to sea level rise is to map areas of  potential future coastal flooding and inundation. The impact of future sea level rise is dependent  upon the level of the ocean at various times in the  future, the topography or elevation of shoreline  areas, and the degree of development or amount  of infrastructure.  ", "781": "By establishing a baseline that shows how storm- related hazards have affected a communitys shoreline planning areas in the past, a Team can  begin to envision how increasingly severe or fre- quent hazards might affect the same areas in the future. It will therefore be better positioned to  monitor and respond to those changes as they oc- cur. Individual or community disaster memories of- ten are short, and photographs or maps of historic  damage or coastal flooding will serve as important reminders of past events for todays planning. A useful initial step for any coastal community  would be for the Team to compile its own his- tory of coastal storm damage over the past 50 or  100 years in order to illustrate to elected officials, agency staff and others that the events to be ex- pected during the future are not necessarily new,  but they will most likely occur with greater fre- quency and intensity than in the past.  There are general databases of past storm his- tory along the California coast that are helpful for  such a compilation (see Griggs and Johnson, 1983;  Griggs and Fulton-Bennett, 1987). Storlazzi and  Griggs (2000) compiled a history of El Nio events  that occurred during the last century. It provides  a good starting point for a search of local records  (newspaper archives, for example) to find evi- dence and documentation of historic storm dam- age. Appendix B lists the major El Nio events by  their relative intensity or severity. ", "782": "The interaction of the physical processes that  produce cliff erosion or retreat, (i.e. wave impact, rainfall and runoff, earthquakes, etc.), with the dif- ferent types of rocks that are exposed along the  coast, has resulted in wide-ranging erosion rates  along Californias 1,100-mile coastline. At some  sites, such as the Monterey peninsula, cliff erosion has been negligible for the 75100 years because  the granite is very hard and resistant to wave at- tack. Ten miles north along the sandy bluffs of southern Monterey Bay, the average rate of re- treat ranges from two to seven feet per year. In  general, weak sedimentary rocks such as the sand- stone, siltstone, mudstone and shale that form  much of Californias coastline, retreat at long-term  average rates of a few inches to a foot or more per  year. Coastal erosion tends to be episodic, however,  with much of the long-term cliff and bluff failure taking place during a few severe storm events ev- ery 5 or 10 years. The arrival of large storm waves at  times of high tides and elevated sea levels, which  frequently occur during major El Nio events, can  produce severe coastal erosion in areas that were  formerly thought to be relatively stable.  Although the average long-term rate of retreat of  the cliffs in Capitola has been about one foot per year, large slabs may collapse overnight, moving  the cliff edge back by 5 to 10 feet, followed by little change for a number of years (Figure 3.22). Short- term cliff erosion rates are often very different from long-term (3050 year) averages and need  to be viewed with caution (Lester, 2005).", "783": "A recommended starting point in assessing future  coastal erosion hazards in a community is to com- pile all of the existing erosion information for your  city or county coastline. There are several sources  for these data, including both site-specific studies as well as regional or statewide compilations.  Most development or re-development proposals  for cliff or bluff-top parcels in California are re- quired to undertake geological and/or geotechni- cal investigations that evaluate cliff stability and retreat rates. These reports should all be on file in Planning Departments by parcel number and they  could be assembled in a GIS base.  The California Coastal Commission recently com- pleted a statewide project that compiled all of the  coastal erosion data in their files from consultant reports into a single database. That information  is publicly available on a CD and it provides a valu- able resource of existing erosion rate data (Dare,  2005).  Living with the Changing California Coast (Griggs,  et al. 2005), includes mile-by-mile hazard maps for  the entire coast of California, including erosion  rates where available. Geologists familiar with  specific areas wrote individual regional chapters and identified and described specific hazardous areas.  Depending upon the extent of coverage of the  existing erosion rate data for a particular city or  county and the extent of undeveloped ocean- front land remaining, there may be a need for and  value in performing a cliff erosion study in order to fill in any gaps. Most coastal cities and counties are already well  aware of the areas within their jurisdictions that  are subject to cliff or bluff erosion problems. The municipalities probably already have building set- back procedures or guidelines in place, as well  as requirements for geological or geotechnical  investigations prior to issuing building permits.  A study of coastal hazard policies for the states  coastal cities and counties completed 20 years ", "784": "ago, however, determined that there was consid- erable variation in how local governments dealt  with issues such as setbacks for cliff and bluff con- struction (Griggs, et al, 1992). Each city and county should begin by re-evaluating  their existing cliff and bluff setback requirements, and the historic erosion rate data to determine  which parcels and structures are located within  setback zones or areas likely to be affected by cliff retreat at specific future times (e.g. 2030, 2050, 2100).  ", "785": "The final step in assessing risk involves evaluat- ing a coastal communitys adaptive capacity,  because its vulnerability to sea level rise depends  not only upon physical stressors to the local shore- line but also on the ability of affected areas to adapt to those changes (NOAA, 2010). The Team  Chapter4 Risk AssessmentPage 30 Adapting to Sea Level Rise: A Guide for Californias Coastal Communities must determine which adaptation options are  available while considering the likelihood that the  highest projected sea level rise may prevail. (See  the following chapter for information about ad- aptation strategies.) The types of effects to be ex- pected as a result of sea level rise, the potential  costs of adaptation, and the longevity of various  adaptation options need to be considered as well.  Adaptive capacity may be described in terms of  a communitys ability to prepare for, respond to,  and recover from sea level rise impacts. A Team  should evaluate the following: 1. regulatory and planning capabilities (e.g., de- velopment restrictions, coastal management  regulations, hazard mitigation, sustainability,  shoreline management, post-disaster recov- ery/emergency plans, etc.); 2. administrative and technical capabilities (e.g.,  the number of sea level rise experts, planners,  engineers, GIS and mapping resources and  modeling capabilities, etc.); 3. fiscal capacity (e.g., taxes, bonds, grants, im- pact fees, withholding spending in hazard  zones and insurance); and 4. infrastructure (e.g., flood and erosion control structures, evacuation routes and redundant  water, wastewater and power systems) . As with the determination of a coastlines vulner- ability to sea level rise, it is helpful to use scenario  planning when determining a coastal communitys  adaptive capacity. A Team should develop a range  of plausible sea level rise outcomes (probabilities  and consequences) based on multiple points in  time (e.g. 2030, 2050 and 2100) and multiple sea  level projections in order to provide a basis for  further adaptation planning. It is recommended  to use the projections for future sea level rise that  are currently employed by Californias state agen- cies: 5-8 inches by 2030, 10-17 inches of sea level  rise by the year 2050 and 40-55 inches by 2100, or  the values that will be developed by the Nation- al Research Councils Sea Level Rise Committee.  Each completed scenario should include quanti- tative projections of future sea level rise and de- scriptions of the potential associated impacts and  consequences.", "786": "Adaptive capacity may be described in terms of  a communitys ability to prepare for, respond to,  and recover from sea level rise impacts.", "787": "After priorities (such as reducing risks to critical  infrastructure from future sea level rise) are  clearly identified, a Team can define its adaptation goals. Goals should establish desired endpoints by  stating the preferred long-term outcomes of ad- aptation to sea level rise. Some examples of goals  include the following (NRC, 2010): 1. a plan or time line for phased relocation of ex- isting infrastructure or public facilities away  from vulnerable areas, 2. site and design all future public works projects  to take into account projections for sea level  rise, 3. eliminate public subsidies for future develop- ment in high hazard coastal areas, 4. prioritize critical public infrastructure for ret- rofitting/protection (storm water/wastewa- ter systems, energy facilities, roads, bridges,  ports), 5. potential removal of barriers to landward mi- gration of heavily used public beaches and es- tuaries/wetlands, 6. develop strategic property acquisition pro- grams to discourage development in hazard- prone areas; encourage relocation; and allow  inland migration of coastal habitats, 7. discourage placement of shoreline armoring  and encourage alternatives, and 8. encourage sustainable forms of development  (such as clustered or higher density develop- ment in low-risk areas).", "788": "PLAN OBJECTIVES AND ACTION MEASURES I t is important to note that the most successful  long-term coastal management programs set  unambiguous, quantifiable, time-bounded objec- tives, (in contrast to vague or open-ended goals).  Specific geographic areas that are of the highest risk, (either due to their low elevations or proximi- ties to retreating cliffs), should be mapped and de- lineated, and timelines should be established for  actions that are based on agreed-upon conditions  or thresholds. For example, by the time high tides  reach a certain elevation, a relocation plan has  been established and action is initiated. Further- more, when a retreating cliff or bluff edge erodes to within a certain distance of a street, sidewalk,  sewer or water line, a clear retreat plan has been  approved. The team should remember to focus primar- ily upon planned or proactive adaptation, as op- posed to reactive adaptation. Reactive adapta- tion includes changes in policy and behaviors that  people and organizations adopt after changes in  coastal risks are observed or communities have  already sustained damage. For example, as prop- erty losses from increasing wave heights and in- creasingly severe coastal storms and sea level  rise increase in frequency, insurance companies  will likely raise their rates or drop coverage alto- gether, resulting in a disincentive to live in hazard  zones. This has already begun to happen along the  hurricane-prone barrier islands that line the South  Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The  purpose of adapting to sea level rise, though, is to  avoid such problems altogether by planning ahead  for the future. In this way, planned adaptation is  intentional, rational, and it aims to address the full  range of sea level rise hazards such that it meets  societal objectives", "789": "A range of criteria may be used for selecting the  best adaptation options for a particular coastal  community. These include actual effectiveness, cost and benefit, ease of design and implementa- tion, and public and political acceptability. Each  potential adaptation measure should be reviewed  individually using those criteria or guidelines. The  Team should recommend to decision-makers the  choices that are most likely to be successfully im- plemented. These may be the most cost-effective, easiest to implement, or most politically accept- able choices.", "790": "There are three different types of future plan- ning or adaptation considerations for coastal  properties in most cities or counties:  1. Undeveloped parcels that are considered or  are zoned to be developable.  2. Existing unprotected development, including  residential and commercial areas as well as in- frastructure (i.e. streets, parking lots, parks,  bike paths, sewer or water lines, etc.). 3. Existing development that has already been  armored. A Team should be aware of the different adapta- tion strategies that are available for both existing  and planned future development. Some communi- ties have highly developed coastlines, while oth- ers that have some undeveloped land could take  advantage of the opportunity to address potential  future issues proactively. Undeveloped land pres- ents the easiest opportunity for planning ahead  or adapting to future sea level rise when taking  into account the very high probability of increased  rates of coastal erosion.  Combining historical cliff or bluff erosion rates with the projected lifespan of any future develop- ADAPTATION STRATEGIES: UNDEVELOPED VS. DEVELOPED LAND ment has been the most common method of de- termining a safe setback distance from an eroding  cliff or bluff edge. However, an increased erosion rate or safety factor needs to be considered, al- though there is not yet an agreed upon statewide  method or value for this. A conservative approach  is strongly recommended. Considering the State- adopted rate of future sea level rise and high prob- ability of inundation or increased cliff or bluff ero- sion, it is the responsibility of an applicant and/or  their consultant to make a case for the safety of a  proposed structure during its lifetime.", "791": "Possible strategies for new, planned development  include mandatory setbacks to restrict develop- ment in vulnerable areas, required warning notic- es to developers and buyers regarding the poten- tial impacts of future sea level rise or cliff retreat, smart growth and clustered development in low- risk areas, and the development of expendable or  mobile structures in vulnerable areas. The word  resiliency is often used to describe a possible  approach to development or land uses in hazard- ous zones. While public lands such as undeveloped  parks, parking lots, bicycle or jogging trails could  be considered resilient, because they can recover  after being flooded or covered with debris follow- ing large storms, it appears that very little private", "792": "coastal development can be considered resilient  or capable of withstanding rising sea level, inunda- tion or wave impact without serious damage.", "793": "An additional issue to consider is the difference between public and private property. A local  Team will probably find that dealing with private property can be far more difficult than dealing ADAPTATION STRATEGIES: PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE PROPERTY with public property. This may be an uphill battle,  but in the long run, the costs of restricting or limit- ing new development in recognized hazard areas  (such as eroding sea cliffs or low-lying areas sub- Chapter5 Developing an Adaptation PlanPage 36 Adapting to Sea Level Rise: A Guide for Californias Coastal Communities ject to flooding or inundation) would be far lower than the costs of dealing with damaged or immi- nently threatened development. For existing private development in vulnerable  areas, strategies for addressing sea level rise im- pacts include: 1. Planned retreat or relocation incentives from  high-risk areas. Establish mandatory rolling  setbacks for any future development or sig- nificant redevelopment in areas that are likely to be affected by sea level rise or cliff retreat within the anticipated lifetime of the structure. 2. Develop a plan and policies and identify fund- ing or tax incentives for purchasing or relocat- ing existing structures out of areas that are  subject to future sea level rise or cliff erosion. 3. Restrict the rebuilding of vulnerable structures  that have been damaged by storms and/or  damage due to sea level rise. 4. Evaluate presently armored areas to deter- mine whether additional armor or retreat is  the most practical long-term approach. 5. Reduce and eliminate dependence on armor- ing (although there may be some critical struc- tures where armoring may provide short to  intermediate-term protection until other solu- tions can be implemented).  For existing public infrastructure or community  resources, whether they be roads, parks, parking  areas, sewer lines or sewage pumping stations: 1. seawalls may provide short-term protection,  depending upon their specific locations and el- evations, but 2. removal and relocation or replacement strate- gies should be regarded as the most effective long-term solutions. Develop retreat orretrofit plans for existing infrastructure that is subject  to future inundation. 3. Design and site all future city or county proj- ects and infrastructure to account for sea level  rise predictions based upon the projected life- spans of the projects. The critical question for each facility or structure  is: Based on the consideration of all of the costs  and benefits as well as the risks, at what point should a community take action? A shoreline  park or parking lot can be used intermittently for  a long time with periodic winter inundation, but a  sewer line or pumping station at beach elevation  must be relocated or replaced well in advance of  flooding or failure", "794": "Before developing final policies, the Team should ensure that is has the support of those  who have the largest stakes in coastal adaptation,  including those elected officials who must ulti- mately approve and stand behind the plan. Open  public meetings can be used to educate the gen- eral public, coastal property owners and elected  officials about the need for an adaptation plan by presenting the impacts and hazards of sea level  rise, the history of past storm and flooding dam- age, future vulnerabilities, and options for recom- mended adaptation approaches.", "795": "Carrying out an adaptation plan requires fund- ing, not only for its initial implementation but  also for periodic updates, since sea level rise is not  a process that will cease at a certain level or on a  specific date in the future. Securing funding may be easiest during times when adaptation to sea  level rise is required by legislation and already on  the agenda of a local government or political body.  Typically, most action or legislation regarding nat- ural hazards takes place immediately following a  large and damaging event and then collective  amnesia sets in and other issues become higher  priorities than sea level rise adaptation planning.  Good examples include the 1989 Loma Prieta  earthquake, and the tsunamis resulting from the  2006 earthquake in Sumatra and in Japan in 2011.  As time passes, funding for area-wide adaptation,  for the execution of regulatory measures and  for those measures requiring large capital invest- ments and follow-up monitoring may be difficult to secure. Some responses to this challenge in- clude tapping into existing complementary organi- zations, (such as coastal management programs),  merging new adaptation policies with planned  coastal development for resilience, and exploring  the use of tourist or user fees"}, "label": {"0": "IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING", "1": "GUIDE PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES", "2": "GUIDE PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES",
