After  completing a vulnerability assessment, you will have identified the risks that have the highest potential to  affect your organizations ability to meet its goals.  The vulnerability assessment process helped you decide which risks to focus on. Now you will identify  actions that might help to decrease those risks and increase the sustainability of your system. Making  these decisions when you have limited resources and probably cannot mitigate all of your risks will not  be easy. Pursuing win-win solutions or no-regrets actions will be appealing options that make sense  regardless of what the future brings.

Involving others will pay off in many ways as you develop your adaptation plan. You will learn what  topics potential partners are concerned about, who can contribute expertise, and whether you have  support for moving forward. The process described in this Workbook is well suited for a collaborative  approach where key stakeholders can participate and work toward consensus. There is no one best way  for communicating with stakeholders, and different methods will be appropriate in different steps of the  Workbook. Workbook steps have lists of resources that can help with external communications. Appendix  B also has cross-references to other guides that may be helpful.  Partnering with another organization in your area that has similar interests in assessing climate change  can be a great opportunity. When you go through your communication and consultation process (Step  1), you should ask if your stakeholders want to join together to assess climate change effects. If you decide to partner with another organization on a vulnerability assessment, Step 2Establishing  the Context for the Vulnerability Assessment provides an opportunity to identify common goals you  will jointly consider. If the other organization is already a key partner, it is likely that there is significant  overlapping interest and a common context can be established for this assessment.  During Step 3Risk Identification and Step 4Risk Analysis, working together to identify and  assess risks can save resources or time, and lead to a common outcome. There can be great benefits  to collaborating, and you certainly should when it makes sense. Partners might assess the same risk  differently simply because their organizations have different purposes. Always remember to keep your  organizations needs in mind.  In Step 6Establishing the Context for the Action Plan and Step 7Risk Evaluation: Deciding on  a Course, partnering opportunities are an important part of the process. Identifying who has mutual  interests and who can take the lead in mitigating particular risks will be a great way to accomplish more  than any organization can do by itself. In Step 9Preparing and Implementing an Action Plan and Step 10Monitoring and Review, let  your partners know how you are doing. You will want to hear about their progress too.", "48": "Process You should reach out to others who are interested  in what you are doing or who can help with your  adaptation planning. Communicate the purpose  of this work to decision-makers within your  organization and to key stakeholders. Everyone  should understand what you are trying to  accomplish and the expected outcomes.  Be able to describe what happens in each of the  steps before reaching out. What you tell and ask  other people will be much more useful if you  know how the rest of the process will unfold.  Some may be involved throughout the entire  process, while others may have a particular  interest in a single step or area of focus. However,  when Step 5 is completed, key people should  not be surprised to learn that you have a climate  change vulnerability assessment and that you  will be using that assessment to determine what  further actions are necessary.  Reaching out Every organization has a unique group of  stakeholders. Local governments, nonprofits,  federal agencies or watershed groups all have  different structures and different parties that  pay attention to what they do. Who is involved  in climate change adaptation planning is an  organizational decision. Leading candidates  would include:   anyone who would be part of  organizational strategic planning;  anyone who would help decide an annual work plan;  anyone who could help with the vulnerability assessment; and  anyone who might be able to help with implementing adaptation actions. Including the public in your planning can be helpful. The Additional Resources section in this step has  many resources about how the community can help, as well as strategies for engaging with them. Communication and consultation should occur throughout your planning, not just when it starts  and ends. Actively review the information developed here in this step and listed in Table 1-1 before  each subsequent step and update it throughout the process to track and guide communication and  consultation efforts.", "49": "Reaching out Every organization has a unique group of  stakeholders.

However, it will be possible to explain what you will be doing, how conclusions will be  reached, and what could be the next steps. Along with the organizational goals and objectives you are  considering for this assessment, key messages should include the following:   This vulnerability assessment is being launched because there is reason to believe that climate  change impacts will affect what your organization is trying to accomplish.  The purpose of the vulnerability assessment is to understand the risks that may occur, the  likelihood of occurrence for each risk, and the consequence if a risk should occur.  Risk management is part of decision-making. If climate changes are going to affect your  organizations ability to reach its goals, then you need to know what the impacts might be in  order to continue being effective.  Different perspectives on risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation are important, and  participation is welcome.  The outcome of the vulnerability assessment is an understanding of likely climate change risks;  any adaptation actions will be determined after that. Key questions for your consultations with stakeholders By nature, your stakeholders are invested and concerned with what you are doing. They can be a great  help as you develop and ultimately implement your adaptation plan. Let them know how you plan to use  their input. Your communication and consultation should strive to find answers to key questions about  how stakeholders can improve your vulnerability assessment or action plan:  Do they have resources, reports or data that they can contribute?  Do they know of any climate change work on stressors or impacts that exists or is ongoing?   Do they want to actively participate in the process or simply be informed of progress or updates?   Can they help with risk identification or risk analysis?  When it is time to decide on adaptation actions, would they be able to help implement actions to  reduce risks?   Do they have any no-gos that you should know about? Are there any topics that they are not  willing to discuss or consider?", "51": "oals are the fundamental elements Goals are the natural unit for seeing what problems climate  change may present and therefore they have important  roles in the vulnerability assessment. Goals describe what your organization intends to achieve,  and are therefore perfect for defining the scope of your  vulnerability assessment. Your vulnerability assessment  should include everything that affects your goals, while  omitting everything that has no effect on them. A useful  Sidebar elaboration defining strategic goals.  Goals Strategic goals should reflect the  broad, long-term, outcomes the agency  aspires to achieve by implementing its  mission. Strategic goals communicate  the agency efforts to address national  problems, needs, challenges, and  opportunities on behalf of the American  people. Both the way strategic goals  are framed and the substance they  communicate are important to consider.  Strategic goals should reflect the  statutory mission of the agency, and  most agency activity will align to the  strategic goals. Strategic goals need not  be as specific as strategic objectives,  however, and need not reflect every  activity that the agency must undertake  to accomplish its mission. OMB. 2013. Circular No. A11 (2013), Section  230Agency Strategic Planning. End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 21 Step 2 test that keeps your task from getting ever larger is to ask whether you would allocate resources for  efforts that have no effect on your goals. Your assessment should focus on the things your organization  cares about. You have already articulated your priorities when setting your goals. In addition, if there is no goal to test against climate stressors, then there will be no risks. The plain detail  that a stressor would cause something to occur in a place does not have meaning within itself. Once it  could affect a goal, an impact takes on a consequence. For example: you might identify that it could rain  tomorrowbut that would be just an incident; for many people that information would have no value.  However if you say it could rain tomorrow and we might not be able to have the picnic we planned, then  you introduce a consequence and you have a risk. A goal is the necessary piece for naming risks. There  will be climate change impacts all over your region but risks can only emerge if you cross climate change  stressors with your goals. Your organization may have goals that would be affected by climate change (e.g., controlling water  pollution or maintaining habitat) but may have others (e.g., recycling waste) that would not be affected  much at all. You will have to decide which of your organizations goals will be considered in this  vulnerability assessment. For a planning-level study like this, you should move forward with all of those  that could be affected by climate change.", "52": "Climate change stressors The Workbook uses seven types of climate change stressors to organize thinking:  Warmer summers (overall climate) This stressor is generally about the warm season being even warmer. This stressor (like warmer  winters, below) is about the general climate. Air, surface, soil and groundwater temperatures will  be warmer. The general climate effects of having warmer oceans or lakes are included here.  Warmer winters (overall climate) This stressor is about a cold season not being as cold as it formerly was.  Warmer water This stressor (regardless of season) comes from a higher temperature of water bodies (including  the ocean) and affects the chemical, physical or biological characteristics of the water body itself.  Increasing drought Drought is a deficiency in precipitation over an extended period. The magnitude of the  deficiency, the duration or the number of droughts could be greater.  Increasing storminess This category encompasses all aspects of intensifying precipitation in any form: more seasonal  precipitation, more total precipitation during events, higher rates of precipitation during events.  Stronger or more frequent instances of extratropical and tropical cyclones, blizzards or other  weather conditions are included here. If they are acting as stressors, then floods, waves, coastal  storm surge and wind are part of this storminess category.  Sea level rise This stressor is about the ocean being higher than it formerly was. It includes effects of higher  water levels right at the shore, as well as how elevated coastal water levels affect inland systems.  Ocean acidification  For the Workbook, this category is primarily conceptualized as related to ocean acidification via  atmospheric inputs of carbon dioxide", "53": "Risk paths Recall that a risk is the possibility that a given climate change stressor will affect your organizations  ability to meet its goals. Stressors and goals are embedded in the risk. You could be prevented from  reaching a goal because the environment changes in some way or because the projects you undertake  to reach your goal would fail in some way.  If there is any potential sequence (climate change stressor, and what follows) for an unwanted  consequence (not reaching your goal), then you have a risk. The risk develops along the path between  the cause and the effect. For example:  Stressor X could , and the result is that we might not attain Goal Y.   Warmer water (stressor) could lead to bacteria being more abundant in the river (path), and we  might not be able to provide healthy drinking water (unrealized goal).   More intense precipitation (stressor) could lead to flooding that knocks a sewage pump station  offline (path) and we might not be able to treat all the sewage that is discharged to the bay  (unrealized goal).  Sea level rise (stressor) will lead to more beach erosion (path) and we might not be able to  maintain the endangered bird species nesting sites (goal). Figure 3-1. The top diagram depicts an ideal business as usual scenario. At your place, your  organization undertakes various projects that help you to achieve your goals. In the bottom diagram a  climate change stressor is introduced to the business as usual situation (or to a no-action scenario). The  stressor could change the way the environment functions or change the effectiveness of the projects  that you would undertake, and potentially lead to unrealized goals.

Paths might involve contingencies or future human activity.  A diagram of a system can be very helpful for visualizing how climate change stressors could alter its  operations. It is not necessary to have climate change stressors in the diagram; the illustrations are just a  tool to help you think about where stressors could introduce unwanted effects. Diagrams can be simple  sketches of sequential events (Figure 3-2). If you can easily locate a conceptual diagram (Appendix D)  for a system comparable to yours, then a tool like that can be useful as well. Diagrams do not have to be  comprehensive or even exact representations of reality. They are simply tools to help you brainstorm and  identify risks. Most strategic initiatives are built on existing processes, and much of the organization is involved in the day-to-day work of delivering service to our customers. The Postal value chain is a series of closely linked processes, supported by a common infrastructure.  The overall quality and cost of the system depends not only on the actions of the Postal Service, but also on the actions of mailers and mail service providers. Value Chain U.S. Postal Service Figure 3-2. A visual depiction of the current system helps with identifying risks. Climate change  stressors like increasing storminess or hotter summers can be imagined to affect efficient mail delivery  in many ways. A diagram like this, from the USPS FY 2012 Annual Report to Congress, helps prompt  questions such as How would more wind and rain affect maintenance at post offices? Would hotter  conditions require more air conditioning? Does increasing temperature affect vehicle or aircraft  operations? Would more intense precipitation or more heat alert days affect mail delivery? You  might have come up with these risks even without an illustrationbut if you can have a diagram that  helps you think, then use it. What you need to do Every path that you can conceive is a risk to a goal and should be recorded in this risk identification step.  At this point, you need to rely on your expertise and knowledge about your system. In this step you want  to come up with as many of those possible pathways as you can.  Cross each climate change stressor with each of the goals you listed in Step 2. The intent is to  generate a list of the ways that each stressor could keep you from reaching the goal. This is much like  a brainstorming session. See Figure 3-3 for an example of how the process works for one goal and one  stressor.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 27 Step 3 Figure 3-3. An example of how to generate a list of what could happen in the space between  introduction of a stressor and failure to realize a goal. Record each risk (stressor, path and goal) in Table 3-3. If a potential risk is not identified in this step, it  will not move forward in the vulnerability assessment process, so write down everything. Step 4Risk  Analysis and Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks are where you analyze and evaluate the list of  risks you generate in this step. Dont dismiss risks! Even risks that you might think are insignificant should be captured in this step. Dont prematurely  dismiss anything. You may learn that a stakeholder thinks it is important, or in some instances further  analysis might show that a risk is not trivial at all. If you dismiss it now, it does not get considered later.  If it is in fact a trivial risk, the systematic process of risk management allows it to be assigned to such  a category in Step 4. Treat this step as a brainstorming session and document every risk you and your  team can identify. Risks are not inevitable A risk is not certain to happen, a risk could happen. You will analyze its likelihood in Step 4. Further, if  you decide that you want to change its likelihood, understanding the risk path could help you to find  ways to take action. You probably cannotby yourselfchange a stressor coming from global climate  change, and you probably dont want to change your goal, so if you do want to change the likelihood or  consequence of the risk you have to disrupt the path that transfers the risk from stressor to goal.  More than one problem from the same cause The same environmental stressor may intersect with several of your goals. You may find that you  seemingly identify the same risk many times. As an example, sea level rise may push saltwater farther up  rivers. This could have implications for drinking water sources, freshwater wetlands or shellfish habitat.  This is why you are asked to note which organizational goal is associated with a risk. Goals are implicitly  embedded in risks.

Help identifying risks This step has four tables (Tables 3-1a through 3-1d) that cross-reference the seven types of climate  change stressors with the purposes of clean water legislation to provide a starter list of more than 100  potential risks. If your organization has other types of goals, then add those goals to a table like Table  3-2 and identify the relevant climate change risks. More places to turn for risk references are listed in the  Additional Resources section. Opportunities (possibility of benefits) You might identify potential circumstances arising from any of the seven climate change stressors that  could be beneficial instead of harmful. These may reduce the severity of some other risk or just be  positive outcomes on their own. If it is the latter, an opportunity may free resources to address other  risks or even change the way your organization goes about business. If you identify any opportunities  related to your organizations goals, make note of them. They will be picked back up in your action plan  to ensure that you take advantage of them.", "54": "Risk paths Recall that a risk is the possibility that a given climate change stressor will affect your organizations  ability to meet its goals. Stressors and goals are embedded in the risk. You could be prevented from  reaching a goal because the environment changes in some way or because the projects you undertake  to reach your goal would fail in some way.  If there is any potential sequence (climate change stressor, and what follows) for an unwanted  consequence (not reaching your goal), then you have a risk. The risk develops along the path between  the cause and the effect. For example:  Stressor X could , and the result is that we might not attain Goal Y.   Warmer water (stressor) could lead to bacteria being more abundant in the river (path), and we  might not be able to provide healthy drinking water (unrealized goal).   More intense precipitation (stressor) could lead to flooding that knocks a sewage pump station  offline (path) and we might not be able to treat all the sewage that is discharged to the bay  (unrealized goal).  Sea level rise (stressor) will lead to more beach erosion (path) and we might not be able to  maintain the endangered bird species nesting sites (goal). Figure 3-1.

You will use Table 4-1 to characterize each  risk in five areas: (1) consequence, (2) likelihood, (3) spatial extent of the impact, (4) time horizon until the  problem begins, and (5) habitat type. This will become important information when your organization  determines its adaptation priorities.  Each risk needs to be assigned to the minimum number of people or teams (ideally just one) who can  provide a reliable initial analysis. You need an initial analysis of each risk along with some documentation  of the sources (which could be expert judgement). Try not to get stuck on determining the likelihood  or consequence of any one risk. Right now this will be an initial or a working determination. As more  information becomes available over time, or as others are able to assist, you can return to this step and  adjust the determination accordingly.  Whereas the Workbook methodology brings others into the process in Step 5, it could be desirable to  include others now if stakeholders indicated that they would help you with this part of your vulnerability  assessment. The involvement of more than one person can lead to differences in whether risks are rated  high, medium or low. The intent of this step is to provide one initial rating so that it can be refined via  wider consultation and participation in Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks. If you do receive  divergent input in this step, you need to come to a conclusion about which rating you will provisionally  adopt. Differences could be worked out here or postponed to Step 5. Figure 4-1. In this step, each risk from the list compiled in Step 3 is separately assigned to someone  (or to a team) who is qualified to come up with qualitative determinations of likelihood, consequence,  spatial extent, time horizon or habitat type. Others will be invited to review these determinations in  Step 5.", "56": "How precise do you need to be? This process requires a determination of the relative importance of each risk. You want to sort risks into a  fitting high-medium-low category: absolute precision is not needed.  Your aim in this step is to have risk determinations that are not wrong. Wrong would be saying high  and later changing a rating to low or vice versa. If the rating is believed to be correct, if you could  make a decent argument as to why you rated it that way and you do not expect to be changing it, if you  would be open to revision if compelling new information were provided, then that is sufficient precision  for this step. It is recommended that you use available information to rate a risk, as you will likely have many risks that  you have to work through and launching a bevy of new research studies will be impractical. Indicate how  the determination was made and what information or who was consulted, and move on to the next risk.  As new information surfaces and others are later able to provide additional information, you can revisit  the determination and adjust it if necessary.", "57": "Who should participate? How you choose to complete your initial risk analysis will be highly influenced by staff capabilities and  interests, as well as by the size, subject fields and availability of the expert pool you turn to. Three main  types of people should be invited to participate in this step: Your in-house staff: No one knows your program as well as the staff. If they have the ability to make a  first determination about the risks, then you should let the staff do as much as they can. Working on this  will also raise their knowledge about climate impacts.

Experts in climate, environmental sciences or natural resources from  government agencies, universities, NGOs or consulting companies who are familiar with your study  area could assist your staff with this climate change risk analysis. Experts could also be asked to do  the analysis themselves. Local experts (like the director of a public works department or professional  landscapers) can also contribute. They might in fact be the best people to estimate the consequence of  a risk. Partners: When you did your initial stakeholder consultation, people may have indicated that they had  expertise or knowledge in particular domains. It will be useful to bring those experts back into the  process now, especially if they said they could help with this step. For example, it may be useful to have  the president of the fishing club weigh in on the consequences of warmer water.

It is helpful to note the justification or source used to determine the likelihood and  consequence of each risk, as it will be a useful reference later on in the process (if you need to revisit this,  or to find out more when you are planning adaptation actions).  The Workbook uses scales with three divisions (high-medium-low). In order for this exercise to be most  useful, you must have a spread of likelihoods and consequences for the risks identified. If everything is  ranked as high-likelihood and high-consequence, the vulnerability assessment process is going to be less  effective as a decision-making tool. In the situation where a disproportionate number of risks are falling  into the high category, you should probably expand your definition of medium to capture more risks.  It may be helpful to define what each category (high-medium-low) means for your organization. Note that in the descriptions below for each parameter, the qualitative category (a) is always best and  (c) is the worst.  Consequence Consequence is the effect the risk would have on your organizations goal were it to occur.  (a) Low (life will go on; not as important as many other things; could adjust) (b) Medium (c) High (major disruption; goal is out of reach or not even attainable) Likelihood Likelihood is the chance of the risk actually occurring (i.e., probability). For the risk, you determine how  likely it is to affect the goal.  (a) Low (b) Medium (c) High For planning purposes you can avoid attaching quantitative probability labels to categories. Unless you  have access to a large team of top scientists and a lot of supercomputers for simulating the climate at the  scale of your study area and running the appropriate hydrological, hydraulic, demographic, land use, and  ecological models, your mathematical estimate of probability is not going to be any more accurate than  the qualitative category anyway.  Since this is a qualitative analysisto aid future decision-making by spreading the risks over three  categories, you could define your likelihoods so that 20%40% of your risks fall in each of the high- medium-low groupings (unless you have a large number of risks that are not likely to occur). All the risks  in the high category would be more likely to occur than those in the medium category, and likewise for  medium and low. Spatial extent Spatial extent refers to the proportion of your geographic area that the risk will affect (recall that the  Introduction states that this Workbook methodology works best at a spatial scale that is large enough  that risks are numerous and diverse and small enough that managers know the territory). Knowing  whether problems are isolated or widespread will help you in the action planning process as you decide  how best to use limited resources.  (a) Site (e.g., a few waterfront lots, a bridge, a sewage treatment plant) (b) Place or region (e.g., community, harbor, state park, wildlife refuge, sub-watershed) (c) Extensive (most of the watershed or most of the estuary) If a different spatial scale is more appropriate for your situation, then feel free to modify these  categories.  Sidebar elaboration on why qualitative scales are emphasized for use in this workbook.  Using a qualitative scale A qualitative scale at this stage is useful for several reasons:  Future changes in the climate system cannot be projected with the exactness that is needed to precisely  quantify the probability of a risk at any given future time.   You might need to contend with well over a hundred distinct risks. It would be prohibitively expensive  to scientifically quantify the likelihood of each one, as well as to estimate the cost of damages each risk  poses. The cost of doing the risk assessment should not exceed the cost of mitigating risks themselves.  The general public has a poor ability to process statistical probability. Research on decision theory  shows that giving people mathematically identical choices elicits different responses depending on how  a problem is framed.   It will be much easier to reach agreement on a qualitative rank (high-medium-low) than on whether  mathematical calculations of likelihood or consequence were done correctly. Some people might elect to use numbers to express a qualitative value (e.g., rank 15). Keep in mind  that these numbers are probably symbolizing subjective values because there is no easy mathematical  way to accurately derive one true quantitative value for each risk. If you are using numerals to represent  opinions, they are still categories. Unless going from category 1 to 2 truly represents the same  quantitative change as going from category 3 to 4, and respectively likewise for all the other numerical  relationships, you cannot properly add, multiply or divide with the numerals, or find their mean (although  median and mode are valid).  Be sure to look ahead to Step 5 and Steps 68b to understand how these categories will be used if you  are tempted to increase the number of categories or to do math with them. Is it really going to be helpful  to use 5-point scales or 10-point scales to generate 25 or 100 different classes of risk? Are you actually  going to use that level of differentiation to make decisions? The key thing here is not to overcomplicate the  process.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 40 Step 4 Time horizon Time horizon until the problem begins will help with developing your action plan. Decisions about low  or medium problems that will not emerge for decades could be postponed. Conversely, high-impact  problems that are already occurring need some attention right away.  (a) More than 30 years (b) 1030 years (c) Already occurring or 010 years Treat the time horizon for the risk as being independent of the likelihood of it occurring. If you think that  absolute dates are more appropriate than relative time periods, choose whatever works best for your  situation. Habitat type Habitat type is a category that is not necessarily a risk dimension. Identifying it now as you go through  your risk analysis and develop your table will become useful later when you work on an action plan in  Steps 610. When deciding on adaptation actions, you may want to group all of the risks associated  with a certain type of habitat. You might, for example, want to see all of the risks associated with tidal  wetlands or with residential areas. Looking across all the associated risks can help you choose adaptation  actions that address more than one risk.", "62": "How to proceed when climate projections give a range of answers Environmental managers have always had to deal with uncertainty when making decisions. It is important  to be transparent about the magnitude of the uncertainty, the range of possible outcomes, and the  resulting justification for making a specific decision. Nevertheless, sufficient information currently exists  to make good determinations about whether a risk is likely to lead to small or large problems. For the purposes of this analysis, knowing the direction  of the change is often enough. For example, you do not  need to determine whether sea level will be 1.25 feet, 1.5  feet or 1.75 feet higher 45 years from now. Instead, think  about what your system will be like when sea level is 1.25  feet, 1.5 feet or 1.75 feet higher in the coming decades.  Similarly, you probably do not need to determine whether  it is going to be 4F or 6F warmer. Think about what the  impacts will be at the low and high ends of your annual  temperature range when temperatures are consistently  warmer than they are now, or phenomena happen earlier  in the spring or later in the fall.  Sidebar elaboration on why the workbook methodology might not be suited for all problems.  Urgent problems Ultimately, if the scale or urgency of a  problem is so big that planning estimates  are not adequate, then you have to turn  to other risk management techniques  for those risks. The methodology of this  Workbook is not the right approach for  problems that need precise, quantified  answers. See Appendix C. End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 41 Step 4 As you are assessing your risks, it may be helpful to indicate the level of certainty associated with each  risk. When you evaluate the risks in Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks and later decide which  ones to move forward with in your action plan, you may find that there are some risks for which there is  great uncertainty and you need more information before investing resources to mitigate them.  When using the Workbook methodology to conduct a vulnerability assessment, use the best available  information and use an iterative process that allows you to reassess the identified risks as new  information arises.  How to proceed when climate projections give opposing answers As you move through your risk analysis, you may discover a situation in which climate projections indicate  different directions of change. For example, while examining the likelihood of more frequent drought  for your watershed, you might discover that some climate models show there will be more precipitation  events and less drought, while other models say that drought conditions will become more frequent. There are lots of climate models, and several standard scenarios that each could run. Because each  model is slightly different and the scenarios differ in their assumptions, every combination will have  a different result than every other simulation. Sometimes model results cluster in a narrow range;  sometimes that range is wider; sometimes the range includes both positive and negative projections of  change. How to proceed is related to how confident you would be about deciding on one direction of change  and its approximate magnitude. Your answers to the following questions about model outputs can  influence your decision:  Do you have an outlier model?  Do you have a continuous range of model results that happens to encompass zero?  Do you have two clusters of model results?  Do you have model results that are scattered all over the place? If your sense is that there is enough of a modeling consensus for you to move forward, then proceed.  But if your sense is that the best available climate change information is saying that anything could  happen, then in the process of gathering more information you have now identified a condition that  might lead to new risks. New risks come because your conclusion that climate could change in opposite ways has introduced a  new stressor. To continue the drought example, the increasing drought stressor would remain and you  would now have an opposite less-frequent drought stressor too. You might not think that less-frequent  drought is a stressor, but it is a change from current conditions and that could lead to some unwanted  changes in the environment. The potential for new risks might best be handled by returning to Step 3 Risk Identification and generating a new set of risks that would stem from the opposite stressor. Then  come back to this step with any newly identified risks. You will have to decide how to allocate likelihood  for the risks associated with the stressor pair. If you concluded that anything could happen then you  probably should not assign high likelihood to risks related to either half of the duo.", "63": "Thresholds or tipping points Tips occur when small actions, events or changes have large effects on future states. Environmental  systems that respond to climate changes by crossing thresholds will complicate your risk analysis. When BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 42 Step 4 an ecological threshold is reached, things that were changing gradually (if at all) suddenly change  abruptly. A low impact suddenly becomes high, or a local problem is suddenly everywhere, or a present/ absent switch occurs. Even if you do not know when a tipping point will be reached, you might be able  to anticipate that it will be reached. When sea level rise will push salty water upstream to a sensitive  freshwater marsh, or when the winter will become a frost-free season, cannot be known precisely.  However, anticipating these thresholds will better prepare you in the event that they do occur.  A risk could have a set of determinations about consequence/likelihood/area/timing that apply before  the threshold is reached and another for after. One strategy would be to split the risk into two risks: a  before-after pair. An alternative is to keep the risk intact and proceed with your risk analysis by answering  some questions:  Do you need to take action anyway? If this is a risk that will warrant attention even before a  threshold is reached, how you choose to respond may also affect the onset of the transition.  Mitigating a low risk now may head off the change to a high risk later.  Is the threshold reversible? If it is crossed, can you take actions that would undo the change, or  is it a one-way transition? Losing an endangered species is irreversible. Sometimes reversing the  change is theoretically possible but unrealistic. Try to stay in the plausible part of the spectrum.  How long will an effective response take? If you must respond to the risk if you do cross the  threshold, is the time to adequately respond short or long? If the consequences after crossing the threshold are high, and (because of permits, costs or other  foreseeable problems) it would take a long time to effectively respondwhether before or after a  tipping point is reachedthen this is a high risk, even if the time of onset is unknown.", "64": "Use existing information This application of the risk management process is intended to be completed with existing information  and resources. New fine-scale climate modeling is not required for the type of qualitative analysis this  vulnerability assessment supports, but use it if it already exists and is easy to obtain.

Solving problems together, dividing up tasks, identifying lead agencies, and  finding who can contribute human or financial resources will help everyone to achieve your common  goals. Although all of the risks you identified in your vulnerability assessment could prevent you from achieving  your goals, your organization may not be able to mitigate every risk.

To accomplish the objective of this step requires a little bit of finessing the chicken and egg dilemma. In  a systematic methodology, like the one this Workbook uses, when you have scores of risks and limited  resources, the dilemma is:   You can choose to mitigate each risk or use some other risk handling approach for each one.  Should you decide your approach before you even know whether there would be any suitable  mitigating actions you could take?  Investigating the options for mitigating a risk will take time and resources. You already know how  many risks are in your vulnerability assessment and that you might never be able to mitigate  each one; further there will be some that you know you never will act to mitigate. Should you still  expend the effort to investigate options for mitigating every risk so that you can make a logical  informed choice about whether to mitigate them? Basicallyshould you decide what to do and then investigate it further, or when you cant do everything  should you still investigate it all before deciding what to do? Trying to have one logical, systematic  process is what introduces the procedural difficulty. By definition, there is no easy way to resolve a  dilemma, but you will try to make it a smaller problem from two directions:  First you will get some familiarity with the mitigating actions that are circulating in the planning  world. Knowing that options might exist for your situation will help you to decide whether  mitigating any risk looks likely to succeed.   Second, because mitigation requires you to expend resources, you will try to screen out risks that  seem suitable for another approach. You want to filter the set of risks to decide where you will focus your resources. The idea is to head out  of this step with a reduced set of risks that you would prefer to mitigate and for which you might be able  to supply an appropriate mitigating action. Recording your high-level approach for each risk in Table 7-1  will set you up for Step 8aFinding Adaptation Actions and Step 8bSelecting Adaptation Actions,  where you will make finer deliberations about how and whether to proceed.  ", "78": "Is mitigation realistic? Mitigating a risk means acting in a way to modify its likelihood or consequence. Right now you simply  want to increase your understanding of the types of actions that would be necessary to lower your risks. BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 57 Step 7 You want to get yourself to the point where you can say that it is realistic to think that a risk could be  lowered if you elected to work on it: then you can make a more informed decision about whether you  want to mitigate each risk or take a different approach. The Climate Ready Estuaries Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas, as well as other  documents (see the Additional Resources section of this step and Step 8a), will provide a sense for  what might work for your location and combination of risks. You might also recognize that some actions  address more than one risk.  While you will not be selecting actions in this step, having some familiarity  with ones your organization could take will be helpful. A fair amount of  work remains in Step 8a and Step 8b before you will select a specific  mitigation technique to use. Do not be too critical right now. In the same  way the Workbook advises not to dismiss risks while you are preparing  your vulnerability assessment, you should not dismiss actions here right  now. You will be tempted to bring in your organizations context or other  knowledge to eliminate possible actions. However, judgments about how  realistic something is will be coming back into this very soon.  For this part of Step 7, just understand what kind of mitigating actions are  in circulation and use your professional knowledge to simply think about  whether any would work to lower your risks if you (or someone else) could  implement them", "79": "Approaches for each risk Although these decisions will be made at a high level, you are deciding an approach for risks that  you determined have the potential to affect your organizations ability to meet its goals. You need to  be prudent as well as aware that how you choose to approach your risks will determine where your  adaptation actions are focused going forward. Your context and constraints will have a big influence on the approach you select. It will be helpful to  consult partners and stakeholders as you determine the approach for each risk. Some risks may be very  important to a stakeholder group, or work may already be underway to address other risks. It will also be  helpful to consider the spatial scale of the impact. You may opt for a different approach depending on  whether it affects a small or large area.  Risk management uses four general approaches for responding to any given risk:  Mitigate.  Transfer.  Accept.  Avoid. Mitigating a risk is the one approach in which your organization would be making changes to the risk  path (Step 3). The other approaches handle risk more administratively.", "80": "Mitigate Mitigating a risk involves taking actions to reduce the likelihood and/or consequence of the threat to  your goals. ", "81": "Transfer Transfer is a technical risk management term for having another organization take responsibility for  reducing the risk. Your risk is mitigated by another party. Buying an insurance policy is an example of  transferring risk by having another party reduce the consequences if the risk occurs. An environmental  management organization will probably not be buying insurance policies, but transfers can occur when  other organizations will act in ways to reduce your risks. Maybe your risk could be mitigated when a  highway is rebuilt or as part of other infrastructure work. Maybe you can agree to lead a reforestation  effort if a partner agrees to restore some other habitat. Maybe some agency has announced it will  be taking hazard mitigation actions that would have the co-benefit of reducing some of your risk. If  others actions are lowering the likelihood or consequence of your risks then you have transferred the  risk reduction responsibility to them. You arent mitigating the risk, but it is being reduced. Note that  you cannot unilaterally transfer a risk. Other organizations need to affirm that they will actually mitigate  the risk; otherwise the risk will still be there. You can opt to transfer some of a risk by partnering with  another organization or by making a financial contribution to someone elses mitigation project. If you  are working with partner organizations on your adaptation plan, this is an opportunity to decide which  organization is going to be the lead for which risks.", "82": "Accept You may have to consider accepting a risk if you are unable to mitigate or transfer it through a viable  strategy. Accepting a risk means that your organization will continue with business as usual and run the  risk, dealing with the impact if/when it does occur. You might choose to accept a risk for some time,  and then later begin to work on mitigating it. Reasons to accept a risk could include a long time horizon  before impacts are expected, inability to locate a suitable mitigation strategy, or a lack of worry about  the consequence of the risk. If more resources or information become available, you can re-evaluate and  decide if there is an opportunity to use another approach besides accept for a risk.  If you dont make a choice to use any other approach, then by default you have elected to accept a risk.  You are running the risk", "83": "Avoid The mitigate/transfer/accept approaches assume that you do not want to change your organizations  goals. If those three approaches are not feasible for you, then you may want to avoid a risk by narrowing  goals that are related to this risk. Avoiding is about being out of the risk altogether so it will not affect  you. Typically, avoiding a risk involves eliminating its root cause. However, since your organization by  itself will not stop climate change from occurring, and since you cannot relocate your place, avoiding  a risk in this context would require a shift in your organizations operations or goals so that you are no  longer exposed to that risk. For example, if one of your goals is to maintain some resource, but you  conclude that climate change is making that a lost cause, you could relinquish that goal. Avoiding a  risk does not mean the impact to the resource or to your place goes awaythis is an administrative  handling of risk in which you move away from this objective and you will no longer put resources toward  it. Avoiding a risk may be a radical move for an organization: you will be pulling back from work that you  thought was important. Reserve this approach for risks that will not be mitigated (by you or others) and  where accepting the risk is a bad proposition.", "84": "Avoid vs. accept The Workbook often states that if more information becomes available you should go back to earlier  steps. In the iterative process of risk management, choosing avoid for a risk appears to be something  new that has lots of other implications for your adaptation plan. If you are renouncing a goal, then all the  risks you identified in Step 3, which derive from that goal, would seem to vanish too. Thus those risks  would fall out of your matrix and vulnerability assessment. If they are not in your vulnerability assessment,  they would not make it into this step of action planning either. Logically, deciding to avoid a risk makes it  and everything related to it disappear. Instead of acting right away on this logic, you should let your choice of avoid sit for now. The  implications to your risks and goals arising from an iteration do not go away but are not an immediate  problem. Instead, you want to leave open the possibility that even more information could be coming.  The risk may turn out to be more benign than you thought; a new risk mitigation technology might  emerge; a new partner may agree to help you with the risk; windfall funding might come in; etc. If you  expunge the risk and the goal from your vulnerability assessment and action plan, you have nothing to  go back to if you do get more information. Keep the risk and the goal, and keep track of the fact that  you chose to avoid the risk. Things might change that would eventually let you select a mitigate/transfer/ accept approach.  Tracking a risk you choose to avoid keeps a goal on the books. You stop working on the goal itself but  do not drop it completely. Pragmatically, it really does not matter what your goal is or is not if you are  not going to put any resources into trying to reach it. The difference between the accept and avoid  approaches to a climate change risk thus become the difference between business as usual toward a  goal and no action toward a goal. Tabl", "85": "hoosing an approach for each risk Every risk that is on your matrixwhether in the high, medium or low categoryrepresents a potential  event that you determined could keep your organization from meeting its goals. In many cases you can  transfer all or some of the risk to a partner, you can simply accept and run a risk, or you can change your  goals so you avoid it altogether. If these are feasible or palatable then they are what you should do.  What you cannot transfer and do not want to accept or avoid, you must mitigate yourself. Mitigating a risk: Every risk that has a potential action that could lower it could be assigned to this  category. Actions that are easy, that you would do in pursuit of no-regrets or win-win solutions, or that  you simply think your organization should do, should be in this category. Accepting a risk: If you turn to your vulnerability assessment, you will find a time horizon determination  for each risk. All green risks in your C/P matrix (Step 5) are good candidates for an accept approach. The  farther out in time they seem to be, the better the accept approach gets. Yellow risks that are decades  away are also good candidates for the accept approach. Not accepting a risk: Risks with a high impact (red risks in your C/P matrix) are bad candidates for the  accept approach. You and your team identified these risks as highly likely to derail your organization. In  order to continue to function as an effective organization that can meet its goals, you should probably  choose another approach for these high-impact risks.  Risks you could accept but should assign for mitigation: These are the green risks that are happening  now as well as the yellow risks that are expected within the next 1030 years. The green risks are low- consequence problems anyway, and you have some time to respond to the yellow risks (unless the  response requires a very long lead time). Assigning them to the mitigation approach has the potential  advantage of keeping them moving through your adaptation planning steps.  If you assign these green or yellow risks to the accept approach, they will be out of sight and out of mind  as you create your action plan. The advantage of bringing them forward is that they will be in front of you  when you are trying to decide the mitigating actions you do need to pursue. Actions that might address BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 61 Step 7 higher risks could address these lower risks too. You might select some actions over others if you are  actively aware that they address lower risks too. Carrying these risks into the mitigation planning (Figure  7-2) may lead to better organizational choices about actions than if the risks are assigned to the accept  approach.", "86": "Further, if the climate changes faster than you expect or if you were too optimistic in your time horizon  determination, then by the time you complete another iteration of your vulnerability assessment, these  unwanted risks may already be upon you.  If you are not sure about mitigation: You are not obligated to start responding, but if you think you  would want to mitigate a risk in the future, then you could benefit from the risk management process  now by assigning it to the mitigation approach. In the systematic risk management process, only those  risks that you identify for mitigation will be carried forward to Step 8a and Step 8b, where you will select  adaptation actions for the risks, and to Step 9, where you will develop your plan. The other riskswhich  you are deciding not to actively mitigate but to transfer/accept/avoidwill be picked up in Step 10 Monitoring and Review after you write your plan. If Step 8a and Step 8b show you that there is not a  viable mitigation strategy for a particular risk, you can return to this step and choose another approach", "87": "Approving the approach After you have investigated and chosen a high-level approach (mitigate/transfer/accept/avoid) for every  one of your risks, your organizations key decision-makers (board of directors, management committee,  staff, and the people who are regularly involved with deciding what you do) should agree before you go  further with your action plan. Your organization is preparing a major strategy document. While this is not  a new strategic plan, it is a statement of how you plan to continue being able to achieve your mission  and goals.  If you selected the avoid approach for any of your risks, you need to carefully think through what this  means. You have chosen to withdraw from whatever goal would be thwarted by the risk. This may be  the whole goal if the goal is narrow (e.g., maintain critical habitat for a particular bird species), or it may  be a part of a goal if the goal is broad (e.g., maintain ecological diversity in your watershed). If you are  deciding to withdraw from pursuing a goal (and thereby in effect rewriting your strategic plan), key  decision-makers should approve this change in course.", "88": "To Get Started You need to mitigate everything that you cannot transfer and do not want to accept or avoid (Figure  7-3). Deciding which risks you want to mitigate may not be the best way to begin. For a first round of  decision-making it may be easier to leave the mitigation option for last, after you have rejected the other  strategies. To get started you should identify the risks that you can transfer to another willing party.  ", "89": "Finding mitigating actions that look promising As you find the points along a risk pathway where opportunities exist to mitigate the risk (Figure 8a-3),  you need to rely on your knowledge about your system to think about what actions might be promising.  You are looking for actions to apply at the relevant spots in the risk path in order to lower the likelihood  or consequence of a risk. Your professional knowledge and training may lead you in certain directions. As you were familiarizing  yourself with options in Step 7, additional ideas may have interested you. If your organization goals are  similar to the Clean Water Act goals, then Table 8a-1 of the Workbook presents the actions from CREs  Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas in a new format that you might find useful. If your  organization has goals specific to the management of water utilities, see resources from EPAs Climate  Ready Water Utilities program. For other sets of organizational goals, the Additional Resources section  at the end of this step points to sources of potential actions.  There are hundreds of potential actions that would alter a risk path and reduce the risks consequence/ probability. Many actions are trivial; some are practically impossible. You want to identify a plausible  range of actions in this step. This is probably not as open-ended a brainstorming exercise as it sounds,  but do not reject things that are novel. You want a range of actions because in Step 8b you may decide  that some are unpalatable for various reasons and should be rejected. Having a plausible range of  actions will help you find opportunities to use actions that might mitigate more than one risk, bring  co-benefits, or open up other opportunities. The best way to solve one particular risk might not be  as advantageous as a second-best way that mitigates other risks too. It is fine (probably desirable) to  identify the same action for more than one risk", "90": "Criteria to assess actions In addition to risk reduction potential, which you conditionally affirmed in the last step, the Workbook uses five other sets of questions (Americas Climate Choices Summary Report, p. 46) to apply to the pool  of potential actions.  Feasibility and effectiveness.  Cost and cost-effectiveness.  Ancillary costs and benefits.  Equity and fairness.  Robustness. Risk reduction potential  You already considered the risk reduction potential of  actions in Step 8a by affirming that you expect each  adaptation action (by itself or by a combination of actions)  to move a risk at least one box on your consequence/ probability matrix. Do you still believe that? Feasibility and effectiveness  Is the action a proven strategy? Are there other  places that have successfully implemented this  action?  Do you have enough time to implement it to prevent  risks from occurring?  Is it politically feasible?  Do you have, or can you get, authority or permission  to implement it?  Is it something your community/stakeholders would  accept? Cost and cost-effectiveness  Is it affordable? Which category does the cost of  the adaptation action fit?  Minor. Sidebar elaboration on what it means to manage for change.  Managing for change Beyond managing for resilience,  the Nations capability to adapt will  ultimately depend on our ability to  be flexible in setting priorities and  managing for change. Prioritizing  actions and balancing competing  management objectives at all scales of  decision making is essential, especially in  the midst of shifting budgets and rapidly  changing ecosystems....Over time, our  ability to manage for resilience of  current systems in the face of climate  change will be limited as temperature  thresholds are exceeded, climate  impacts become severe and irreversible,  and socioeconomic costs of maintaining  existing ecosystem structures, functions,  and services become excessive. At this  point, it will be necessary to manage  for change, with a re-examination of  priorities and a shift to adaptation  options that incorporate information on  projected ecosystem changes.

Very expensive, requiring external assistance.  Overwhelming and impossible.  Is the cost reasonable for the risk reduction an  action would produce?  Did you consider if there are long-term maintenance  costs?  Does the action prevent other future costs or  damages?  Will the action generate positive economic benefits? Some of the most effective options may also be the most  expensive. The conversethe cheapest actions might be  the least effectivealso holds. Later in this step you will  consider how your available resources affect how many  actions you can implement and how much risk reduction  you can achieve. Ancillary costs and benefits  Is the action maladaptive?  Does action in one sector/place cause problems  in another sector/place?  Will action to reduce some risks encourage  people to take other risks they would have  avoided otherwise?  Does the action close off other options or lock  the future onto one path?  Co-benefitsdoes an action create positive side  effects that help with other non-climate problems or  with more than one climate change risk?  Sustainabilityis there a balance between the  social, environmental and economic costs and  benefits of this action?  Are needs of present and of future generations  considered?  Are there adverse impacts on the environment,  ecosystem functions or ecosystem services? Equity and fairness  Does it align with your ethics and principles?  Does it cause a minority population or low-income  population to bear disproportionately high and  adverse effects?  Sidebar elaboration on the definition of sustainability and its three pillars.  Sustainability [S]ustainability and sustainable  mean to create and maintain conditions,  under which humans and nature can  exist in productive harmony, that permit  fulfilling the social, economic, and other  requirements of present and future  generations. Executive Order 13514 of October 5,  2009 The ultimate goal of adaptation is to  create a sustainable place (otherwise  adaptation actions are just patches and  short-term fixes). You want to create  places that will be resilient to the risks  that future climate changes will pose.  The National Research Council  recommends the Three Pillars  approach of Social, Environment, and  Economic dimensions of sustainability.  The intent is to create an integrated,  forward-thinking approach that takes all  of those elements into account. National Research Council. 2011.  Sustainability and the U.S. EPA.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 84 Step 8b  Are many asked to pay for benefits that accrue to just a few?  Does the action limit the adaptation options of other places or sectors? Robustness  Given inherent uncertainty about the future, will the action perform under a range of potential  conditions?  Is it a flexible adaptation action? Can it be modified at a future date if the climate changes  differently than expected?  Are you putting all your eggs in one basket, or is this action part of a coordinated set of actions?  Is it a no-regrets action? Is it just a good idea regardless of how climate might change?   Is it a win-win action? Would it also be a good strategy for achieving other desired social,  environmental or economic results?  Are there any circumstances where you would become sorry you implemented this action? These six tests can have many parts and the tests are not simple pass/fail questions. You are trying  to find actions that are desirable as well as effectiveand you want to avoid problematic actions.  These screening tests are really about deciding whether an action is unsuitable or appropriate for your  organization. Record your conclusions in Table 8b-1 and note whether you are willing to proceed with  each action.", "91": "Reviewing the screening assessment Not every action will pass all the tests. You truly do not want to implement actions that will not work,  that you cannot afford, or that cause other problems, but be alert for ways to compensate for those  problems. Which tests an action fails matter.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 85 Step 8b  If you disqualified an action because you cannot afford it, you might be able to transfer that risk  to others who can pay the costs. Alternatively you may need to focus attention on finding the  funds.  If the impediments are political or structural, then your first acts toward reducing a risk may be to  find ways to overcome those obstacles.  If an action generates unwanted effects, then those tradeoffs might be mitigated too. You may not be able to find any actions for some risks.  If you cannot find a single mitigating action for a risk that passes your screening tests and that you  want to implement, then a potential partner probably will not find one either, so transferring this  risk may not work. You probably need to accept or avoid the risk.   Keep track of actions that failed one or more of the screening tests because conditions may  change over time and these actions may become more attractive in the future. The best actions will pass each screening question. Actions that do satisfactorily on your tests will move  forward for further consideration of their risk reduction potential in the rest of this step.  Risk-based ranking of actions This Workbook assumes (as expressed in the Introduction) that users will have to prioritize response  actions because not all can be implemented. The mitigating actions that pass the six criteria will address  a variety of risks that will affect different goals, that will occur in different habitat types, and that range  from high-impact risks (red in your matrix) to low-impact risks (green).  In a risk management process, the best actions will be the ones that achieve the most risk reduction.  Your task now is to sort all of your screened actions according to how much of your climate change risk  they will mitigate. For each action, you first need to return to the C/P matrix and see whether the primary target of the  action is a red, yellow or green risk. Do a rough sort of your list so that actions that respond to red risks  are at the top, and actions that respond only to green risks are at the bottom (Figure 8b-2, left). What follows is a set of decision-making guidelines that will help you refine the rough sorting. Some  actions are more attractive because they respond to your organizations total risk better than others, and  they should float higher on your list. Note that a group of actions can be assessed as one coordinated  set. Your C/P matrix and the information you developed about the action in Step 8a will help you to  construct the ranking.  Actions that address red risks  Responding to red risks should be at the top of the list. You said these risks are highly likely to  happen and will have high impacts when they do. Actions that would mitigate a red risk should  get priority over responses to a yellow risk.  Actions that reduce more than one risk are more attractive than comparable ones that reduce  only one risk. Be sure the main target risk is making real movement to the lower left of your  matrix. Do not do a little bit for a red risk just because it also does a little for a yellow risk: focus  on meaningfully reducing risk.  Actions that would move red risks closer to the lower left corner of your matrix are more attractive  than comparable actions that would leave them further away. But do not spend a fortune to  mitigate risks down to zero if getting them into the green zone is sufficient.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 86 Step 8b  Do not duplicate efforts unless you intend to. You should not expend resources to implement  more than one solitary action to achieve the same risk reduction, but if an action is part of  a coordinated set of risk reducing actions, that is fine. If an action is part of a planned set of  redundant actions, that is fine too. Actions that address yellow risks  Yellow risks should not be the primary target of your efforts unless you have no red risks. Look for  opportunities to move yellow risks into the green zone as part of your work on other red risks.  You may have an opportunity to take an action that would reduce a few yellow risks instead  of taking another action that would reduce one red risk. This is a judgment call based on the  magnitude of all the contextual benefits each choice could achieve. However, do not work to  clean out the yellow zone while leaving red risks intact. Actions that only address green risks  Actions that respond only to green risks should be at the bottom of your list. You have decided  these risks are less likely to occur and would not matter as much if they did. You probably should  not dedicate any resources to them that would take away from responding to yellow or red risks.   Actions that have negligible costs (in time and money) and can be taken as a part of other normal  business are more attractive than other actions aimed at green risks.  Instead of launching a project aimed at a green risk, look for opportunities to fine-tune an  action you will use to address a red or yellow risk. Maybe those actions can incorporate a small  component that further reduces green risks. After you assess your pool of actions, you should have a relative ranking (like the example on the right  side of Figure 8b-1) of the whole set of actions based on how much of your organizations overall risk they  reduce. This is a risk-based ordering of actions.  Selecting actions for implementation You are setting out to reduce the overall climate change  risk to your organization. A risk-based ordering of actions  means that each action (or coordinated set of actions)  reduces more risk than the item below it on the list. If  you moved actions to be out of sequence on the list  (either further up or further down), then some actions that  reduce less risk would appear higher on your list than  actions that reduce more risk. If you need to prioritize response actions because you will  not be able to implement them all, the next thing is to  divide your actions into two tiers. Tier 1 actions are the  ones your organization has the capacity to start on within  your workplan cycle. Tier 2 is the waiting list. Taking into  account your organizations financial and human  resources, you should draw a line separating the actions into Tier 1 and Tier 2 as far down from the top  of the list as you can in order to maximize the number of actions in Tier 1 (Figure 8b-2). If Tier 1 reaches down to an action that you cannot afford but you can afford more actions below that  particularly expensive one, then: (1) note that one action is too costly and that you are skipping it in this", "92": "work planning cyclebut dont change its place in the ordered listand (2) move the line down so that  as many actions as you can afford are in Tier 1. The actions in Tier 1 generate the most risk reduction you can realize at this time. Tier 1 actions will move  into Step 9 for implementation. The actions that are beyond your current capacity will be in Tier 2 and  will not move forward right now. Actions that you skip are technically in Tier 2, but keep their place in the  ordered list.", "93": "Concept approval In Step 7, you may have worked with your partners to negotiate a transfer of certain risks. You may also  have decided to run some risks by choosing to accept them. You may have decided to avoid some risks.  You decided to try to mitigate the remaining risks. You also confirmed with your key decision-makers that  they concur with the high-level approach for each risk. In Step 8b, you selected promising adaptation  actions for all the risks you intend to mitigate, and you are proposing to move that set forward for project  design and implementation. Before you go further with your action plan, this is another opportunity to  run it by your organization board of directors, management committee, staff, and the people who are  regularly involved in decisions for their concurrence about how you propose to manage your risks. A planning-level plan In this last planning-level step, you will create the  mechanisms to ensure that you make progress. You want  to create two risk management tracking systems. One  tracks the actions; the other tracks the risks. You will create  two tables that start as inverses of each other. Each table  should be updated regularly. The first table (Table 9-1) tracks the actions and notes  which risks they are associated with as well as who has  responsibility for implementing them. An action may  address more than one risk. The second table (Table 9-2) keeps track of your risks and  notes what actions are being used and when they are  completed. A risk may be affected by more than one  action. You should also track any activities associated with  risks transferred to another organization. From planning level to project level  The Workbook is designed to help you create a planning  document for managing risks at a watershed scale. Once a  responsible person is named for implementing an action,  what comes next is beyond the scope of this Workbook.

Conditions are always changing, so  incorporate any new information to ensure the best plan is  still in place. Considerations for monitoring and review  include: Context: The context of your organization has been used  to help you identify risks relating to your goals, as well  as determine the unique circumstances under which you  operate and will be able to address your risks.  As time passes, your context may change, so your plan  will need to be adjusted to suit these changes. Your  organization may take on new challenges and have new  goals. Your budget or personnel may change. Perhaps the  political situation in which you operate evolves. Or maybe  you identify more partners to transfer risks tofreeing up  more resources and time for you to address other risks.  In any case, you will need to review and revise your action  plan to reflect changes in your regulatory, political and  financial context and ensure the plan reflects your current  context. Climate change: New climate change science will likely emerge after you have completed your  adaptation plan. Information about magnitude of projected changes and new knowledge about  expected impacts will continue to be improved. Incorporate new information (e.g., science, data) as it  becomes available so that your plan stays current and effectively addresses your risks.

Questions to consider How often should the planning team  meet to review the plan and discuss its  progress? How will the planning team keep key  decision-makers apprised of progress  and obstacles?

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 99 Step 10 Risks: Your risks will likely evolve over time as well,  especially as climate changes accumulate or interact. What  used to be a moderate risk could become a more severe  risk over time, one you feel needs to be addressed sooner  rather than later. Your own mitigating actions hopefully  change how you would assess a risk, too. Update your plan  to reflect changes and continue through the subsequent  steps to revise your action plan.  Action plan: Your action plan is meant to be a living  document. You should update it often, especially if  anything changes regarding your context, if new climate  change science emerges, if new risks are identified, or if  current risks become a more imminent danger than when  you first addressed them. It is also useful to review the  action plan to ensure that actions being implemented are  having the intended effect (and not having unintended  negative effects).

The framework can be adapted by  communities anywhere in the country for their context and can be modified to cover small or  large geographic areas and their economies. Communities existing plans can inform this  framework, since issues such as vulnerability to floods will have been addressed in the local  hazard mitigation plan and perhaps the comprehensive plan.

Engaging the  right partners is critical, particularly in the private sector, as economic resilience will depend in  large part on what individual business and property owners do.  In step 2, the team evaluates which climate change impacts could affect the community and  where might they occur. The frameworks flexibility allows the assessment team to opt for a  basic, moderate, or more advanced approach. A basic approach could use regional climate  change scenarios to get a general sense of what impacts are likely to occur in the community. A  more advanced approach could include working with climate change specialists and assessment  tools such as GIS and hazard impact models. Either way, the goal is to determine what portion(s)  of the communitys geographic area are projected to be affected by climate-related hazards (e.g.,  flooding, drought, extreme heat).

A sample table shows how the team could organize the  information to make the risks and opportunities easier to identify. After identifying the assets, the  team determines each assets vulnerability by looking at the assets exposure to the threat, the  effect on operations, and the ability to adapt or protect itself. The team also summarizes potential  positive and negative impacts on the economy if the asset is affected by a climate hazard.  In step 4, the assessment team uses the information in the table to analyze the overall economic  implications for the community. In this step, the team develops a comprehensive picture of local  economic risks and opportunities associated with climate change.  Finally, in step 5, the team explores options to enhance resilience and pursue economic  opportunities that could come with climate change. The team works with the community to  identify actions that the public and private sectors can take to increase resilience. The actions  included in this step are a sample of actions communities might choose to take and were selected  because they bring multiple benefits in addition to building resilience or adapting to climate  change.

Coordinating the framework with the  comprehensive plan can provide a mechanism for  implementing the policies and actions that would  enhance resilience in the local economy.

Climate Change Impacts  The 2014 National Climate Assessment  summarizes changes to the global climate and  observed and projected impacts in the United  States. For the country as a whole, temperatures  are projected to continue to rise.

For example, in the Northeast region, the  assessment notes that, Between 1895 and 2011,  temperatures in the Northeast increased by  almost 2F (0.16F per decade), and precipitation  increased by approximately five inches, or more  than 10 percent (0.4 inches per decade).

Climate Change Impacts on Local Economies  Communities can face many stressors, such as rapid population increases or losses, aging public  infrastructure, economic fluctuations, volatile or unpredictable energy prices, and natural  hazards. Climate change is likely to exacerbate many of these challengesfor example, by  damaging infrastructure, which requires more frequent repair and maintenance and costs local  and state governments more money, or changing environmental conditions in ways that affect  local industries such as fisheries or tourism. A resilient community will continue to thrive in the  face of those stressors.  A resilient community will also find ways to adapt its economy to opportunities that arise from  the changing climate. Opportunities could come from changing consumer preferences,  consumption patterns, demands for new products and services (including those that are climate  resilient), major public infrastructure engineering and construction, and alternative supply chain  services.  Businesses that can operate with minimal interruption during and after extreme weather events  could have a competitive advantage over less-prepared companies.

If the community has already conducted a  climate vulnerability assessment, the team can select projections from that analysis to use for  economic assessment. Community economic development leaders are often interested in longer  range projections to have time to plan for anticipated trends, while individual businesses might  want to look 15 or 30 years into the future, depending on their product or service and lease or  ownership status. The team can consider the objectives and resources that it established in step 1  and select the most appropriate scenarios.  If the community does not have a completed climate vulnerability assessment or other related  studies from which to draw, the team will need to determine what it will use based on how it  intends to obtain climate impact information and what is available.  For the basic approach, communities with no climate change projections for their geographic  area can use regional scenarios developed for the National Climate Assessment and tools from  federal agencies and nongovernmental groups to get a general sense of impacts likely to occur in  their region (see appendix C for links to resources). Some states have more regionally specific  climate change projections, and some regions have also developed finer-grained projections. For  the moderate or advanced approach, the team can work with climate change specialists to  develop finer-grained projections for the community. Many universities have climate change  specialists who could help conduct more in-depth analyses of local climate change projections.  To ensure it can explain and defend the assumptions underlying the assessment, the team should  document the climate change scenarios it selected and why (e.g., data availability or relationship  to the community goals and objectives). The team should keep in mind, however, that just as  communities use demographic, economic, and other estimates and projections in planning and  decision-making, it can use a plausible future scenario such as those described in the National  Climate Assessment as a reasonable basis for the assessment. It does not need to narrow down  projections to precise numbers, simply to a plausible range for future conditions.

For team planning purposes, analysis of each climate-induced  hazard (e.g., storm, flood, drought) for a community the size of North Kingstown could take  approximately eight to 24 hours. The team can approximate affected areas and identify the assets  to create a general consequence assessment that estimates what would be affected and how that  might affect the community. The moderate approach gives the team a better sense of the location and magnitude of potential  impacts. The team would use digital data and GIS tools for this approach. This analysis might  take more time and resources, depending on the availability of GIS data, but it can provide a  more accurate depiction of the assets exposed to climate-related hazards and help the community  identify appropriate adaptation strategies.

Whether a utility is publicly or privately owned will not necessarily affect its risk, but its ownership is important for the team to know when discussing potential actions to improve resilience. When filling out the assessment form, consult with local utilities if they do not have representatives on the assessment team.   Critical emergency response facilities and equipment could be flooded or rendered inaccessible or inoperable during disasters.

Green spaces, including wetlands, salt marshes, flood plains, meadows, and woods, naturally filter and store rainfall. Trees provide shade, reduce ambient air temperatures, sequester carbon dioxide, and increase property values and commercial activity.   Climate change puts city tree canopies and local forests used for production at more risk from fire, drought, and pest infestation.   Climate change can shift the range of where certain species live, affecting local fishing, hunting, tourism, and agriculture.", "161": "A vulnerability scale lets the team distill diverse factors for each asset into a representative  vulnerability designation where possible. It is not necessary to spend a great deal of time refining  this scale. The important thing is to have a consistent basis for distinguishing where climate- related hazards pose the greatest risk to the local economy. The sample assessment form uses high, moderate, low, and none as a scale to help  estimate and compare assets vulnerability to various climate impacts. The team could establish  ranges for each level; for example, a low level of risk might be that 1 to 5 percent of the asset  category could be affected by the climate hazard, a moderate level could be 5 to 20 percent, and  a high level could be more than 20 percent. To bracket the ranges, the team could consider  factors such as value of the assets, potential for collateral impact (i.e., dependence of other  economic activities on those assets), or similar concerns. Ultimately, the team can use whatever  scale it wants based on the communitys context and threats.  Once the team has defined a scale, it can apply it to each identified asset for each climate  change-related hazard. Some hazards (e.g., sea level rise, flood, and storm surge) affect only  specific areas of the community, while others such as drought and extreme heat might affect the  entire community.

Identify Opportunities for Community  Participation Community members beyond the steering committee should par- ticipate to shape the outcome of the planning process. Examples of  targeted participation opportunities include holding focus group  meetings, conducting workshops, and addressing the topic during  neighborhood gatherings, home owner association meetings, and  town hall (general public) meetings as well as multi-media events such  as broadcasts and surveys. An effective example of Community Partici- pation in a sea level rise planning effort is to walk through a Strengths,  Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis to outline  issues more systematically. Participation activities such as these can  help to build and strengthen stakeholder and community support for  the project as well as serve to highlight concern areas that the plan- ning team may not have previously considered or addressed.", "236": "1.4.1.

In addition,  the planning, zoning, stormwater, and public works departments may  create project scope and manage implementable projects that result  from the planning effort. This guidance during strategic development  will assist future project implementation. Neighboring community  stakeholders may be able to enlighten the community by sharing their  own adaptation or mitigation experience.", "240": "Community Organizations and Leaders  Community organizations and leaders comprise an additional stake- holder group to engage. Connections can be made by reviewing  their event calendars and meeting agendas to find a time and way to  introduce the adaptation planning process and enlist their involve- ment. Potential partners may include church groups, rotary clubs,  civic organizations, homeowners associations, and specific interest  groups. Community partnerships can provide support and local buy-in  to adaptation and resiliency planning efforts. To increase stakeholder  engagement, it is well served to utilize existing community activities  and forums where individuals are already involved.  ", "241": "1.4.2. Public Outreach Approach Public participation is important for identifying social, cultural, eco- nomic, and physical factors, which need to be considered during the  establishment of guiding principles used to develop community adap- tation strategies. It is also the appropriate avenue for socializing the  plan. When local ideas, concerns, and preferences are considered,  adaptation strategies can be tailored to meet community needs and  desires. Plans and policy that are developed with broad stakeholder  participation are more likely to be well-received and gain public support  when residents have participated in the process from the start. While  some members of the public may not welcome the process initially,  walking them through the various components generally helps estab- lish valid and urgent reasons why sea level rise adaptation is needed.", "242": "General Public Often, members of the public have had experiences in the past that  can significantly contribute to discussions of vulnerabilities and adap- tation possibilities. The wealth of knowledge in the local community  should not be discounted, and every effort should be made to gather  it and use it. The first step is education and awareness, allowing individuals to truly  understand the threats of sea level rise and flooding based on the  effects of total water level. Efforts to educate local stakeholders on  current and future flood hazards can be enhanced by directly engag- ing the public using nontraditional outreach techniques, such as social  media and interviews. Looking ahead, todays youth will be the ones inheriting the full brunt  of sea level rise, greater storm surge events, and extreme precipitation  that leads to devastating floods. Future generations will continue the  task of addressing these climate issues, and some individuals will likely  embrace involvement. Youth can help contribute their skill with things  like social media to enhance the outreach effort. They also can bring  energy, a fresh perspective, dedication to shaping their future, and  willingness to think outside the box to help find innovative ideas and  concepts to advance adaptation planning.", "243": "Outreach Strategies The success of adaptation strategies largely depends upon confidence  in the idea that reductions in long-term risk exposure, combined with  present day mitigation efforts, will be sustained. Outreach is an import- ant activity that can help build this confidence and lead to future action;  however, each communitys outreach strategy will be unique to reflect  local conditions. To ensure that adaptation is well received in the com- munity, simply posting information on the citys website is a first step  although it will not be adequate on its own. Positive public informa- tion efforts that outline what people can do are more likely to impact  behavior. It is not enough that people know they are in a hazardous  area; they need to want to do something about it. Community mem- bers must understand the effects each strategy will have on them and  what actions they can take. Therefore, messaging is very important.  ", "244": "A key public engagement approach is to shift from telling towards  asking about what should be done. Residents are deeply connected  to where they live, and crowdsourcing information can add a new layer  to components like the Vulnerability Assessment (e.g., allow citizens to  tell their personal experiences of how their homes, streets, or the busi- nesses they frequent have been impacted by king tides and pinpoint  these locations on a map with a tag describing the impact).", "245": "It is important to prepare for outreach  and create specific content areas. A com- munity with a proactive outreach strategy  that speaks to specific community social  and political views will have a greater  chance of moving beyond informing to  prompting community members to act.  Determining the different stakeholder  views will lend itself to a more tailored  and appropriate outreach strategy, a chal- lenging task. As part of an early outreach  strategy, it is recommended to incorporate  a chart of the recorded sea levels for the  nearest NOAA tide gauge over the last 50  to 75 years to represent the historic sea  level rise trend. This action should help  establish evidence-based reasons for  approaching adaptation, help get beyond  personal opinions, and start a process of  deeper community conversations about  what to do about sea level rise.", "246": "The following table details a spectrum of stakeholder participation methods, ranging from in-person to internet communication. The planning team is  encouraged to evaluate which method may work best at each of the six public participation points of the adaptation planning process. Method Description Advisory group/task  force Small group of people representing various interests set up to give advice on programs or actions. In this planning process, an  advisory group of more technically oriented individuals may be appropriate for something like Exposure Analysis. App A program that operates on a smartphone. Could be used to poll, disseminate information, or provide services. Charrette Intense, single or even multi-day effort to design something or solve a problem. Field trip Trip to specific location organized so that participants can match mental images to real conditions. Focus group Small discussion group led by a facilitator who draws out in-depth stakeholder input on specific questions. Hotline Widely advertised telephone number that directs callers to someone who can answer questions and collect input. Interview Face-to-face or telephone interaction with stakeholders conducted by the agency or by a third-party representative. Large group/small  group meeting Opening presentation then division into smaller groups to discuss an issue or complete a task. Open house  Event in which the public is invited to visit a location with staffed booths or stations. These stations could include areas with  maps (either paper maps or computer stations) facilitated by the meeting organizers staffed with various subject matters  experts. Poll or Survey Written or oral lists of questions to solicit community impressions/facts about issues at a specific moment in time. Public hearing Formal, single meeting where stakeholders present official statements and positions that are recorded. Public meeting Large public comment meeting where comments are made to entire audience. Referendum A direct vote by the whole electorate on its support of specific proposals. Retreat Concentrated, informal meeting that emphasizes social interaction as well as issue discussion. Social media Information and interactive event and issue marketing carried out through web and app platforms such as Facebook, Twitter,  and Instagram. Story map An interactive, web-based map that provides enhanced information about locations. Town hall meeting Less formal public hearing where stakeholders have the opportunity to speak and/or vote. Website An online resource center that may provide (on the front end) information, interactive data, feedback mechanisms, and (on the  back end) analytics to administrators. Workshop Small stakeholder gathering, typically fewer than 25 people, designed to complete a specific assignment in a short time period.

Best Practices in Stakeholder Involvement Best practices in stakeholder involvement and participation are deter- mined by the principles established at the beginning of the planning  process and are the preferred end result of the chosen strategy.  Depending on the type of audience and engagement, the best possible  techniques for stakeholder involvement will vary. All of the best prac- tice strategies may not be applicable for each stage in the adaptation  planning process, but all are factors that can shape how community  involvement may be designed.

This is a step-by-step methodology presented in a logical  sequence that will help lead a community to priority actions and pri- ority areas. The Exposure Analysis visually represents the potential  encroachment of the sea into land areas, and the Sensitivity Analysis illustrates the variety of entities that may be affected by a rise. Each  community may adapt the Exposure and Sensitivity Analyses to suit  their own priorities. With these analyses in hand, the community can  turn its decision making toward assigning Focus Areas. Focus Areas constitute the selected locations where the Adaptation Strategies  component will direct its attention.", "250": "To ultimately write an adaptation plan that reflects the expertise and  interests of the communitys local stakeholders, public involvement  should be included at each step. Community members need to know  about the potential threat of coastal flooding, and they need to know  concrete information about the planning being done to confront it.  Early introduction of sea level rise visualization tools can indicate the  great level of detail that scientists have already committed to project- ing and mapping future change and can be very tangibly felt when  shown in a specific community. Integrating testimonials of those who  have perceived experience with sea level rise can contribute to the  authenticity and local focus of the process. Longtime residents of an  area may contribute valuable information about lost barrier islands or  coastal areas where they once recreated or did business. Often vulner- abilities are brought out by community members that are not evident  from mapping and studies.", "251": "2.1.

Planning teams are encouraged to use the tool that has the highest res- olution (e.g., most elevation readings per unit-area of land) to increase  accuracy. Previous Florida sea level rise assessments have shown that  achieving the highest resolution in a sea level rise tool may require  in-house or contracted specialist GIS work to produce a map of expo- sure specific to the community.

Deciding on Focus Areas is a step where the planning team engages  the community to address the findings from the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses. It is recommended that before the Vulnerability Assess- ment begins, criteria be established to guide the publics input (e.g.,  Focus Areas are established where critical facilities or infrastructure  are located and/or where the highest affected population resides).

The Exposure Analysis process may be defined in four steps.  First, a sea level rise model is chosen. Secondly, horizon dates (e.g.,  2040, 2070) are selected to guide the models first output. Then the  model calculates static sea level rise elevations (and can also predict  other changes to local coastal landscapes) for how much sea level  rise is probable at the chosen horizon time points. Finally, future inun- dation areas are located (typically within a GIS map window). The out- put of this step is important because it generates a listing or mapping  of the coastal areas that are likely to be impacted.

Fiscal capacity (e.g., taxes, bonds, grants, impact fees, with- holding spending in hazard zones, and insurance); and 4. Infrastructure (e.g., flood and erosion control structures, evac- uation routes and redundant water, wastewater, and power  systems).", "269": "3.2. Prioritize Adaptation Needs Once the adaptive capacities of the local community have been identi- fied, a prioritization framework can follow. At this point in the planning  process, the community should be aware of the impacts of potential  sea level rise and inland flooding, have identified its focus areas to  address the impacts, and/or have inventoried the capacity of the com- munity to adapt. It is at this step that the community combines those  findings and creates a short list of its biggest challenges to determine  what can feasibly be done where and when.16 Articulating a communitys biggest challenges to sea level rise is a nec- essary step in identifying adaptation needs. For example: The most  important challenge facing the local agency is adequately address- ing the current state of the wastewater treatment plant which is at  increased risk to flooding or Elevating the many bridges in the local  agencys jurisdiction to withstand 2 feet of sea level rise is our high- est priority. Prioritizing adaptation needs sets the stage for the next  sub-component  creating specific adaptation strategies. Prioritization can be as simple as selecting the needs that can be  addressed currently (using capacities already identified as robust in the  Assess Adaptive Capacity step or categorized as low-hanging fruit)  and saving the more involved solutions for later. Conversely, it may  be more important for a local agency to tackle large-scale expected  impacts first, regardless of cost and complication, due to urgency", "270": "3.3. Identify Adaptation Strategies  Once major needs and priorities are defined, specific adaptation strat- egies can be developed, vetted, and defined. It is very important to  note that many options are available when an area is projected to be  flooded, either permanently or intermittently. A community can select  from a wide range of adaptation strategies in the following categories:  Protection, Accommodation, Retreat, and Avoidance. ", "271": "Protection strategies involve both hard and soft (or gray and  green) structurally defensive measures to mitigate impacts of rising  seas while leaving the vulnerable structures behind these measures  largely unaltered. Seawalls, revetments, and levees are examples of  hard or gray protection strategies, while beach nourishment, oyster  reef restoration, and living shorelines are all examples of green protec- tion strategies.", "272": "Accommodation strategies alter physical design to allow the structure  or land use to stay in place. Examples of this are floodable develop- ment, floating structures, and increased stormwater storage via imple- mentation of Low Impact Development or Green infrastructure (LID/ GI) in upstream locations. LID/GI upstream improvements reduce  downstream flows by allowing more stormwater to infiltrate in place,  thereby taking the pressure off the existing downstream stormwater  infrastructure. In the Netherlands, a concept known as Room for the  River helps dictate land use compatible with periodic flooding being  designated adjacent to all major Dutch rivers.  ", "273": "Retreat from areas or infrastructure where protection or accommoda- tion will not be efficient or effective can be voluntary, incentivized, or  done gradually. It can also involve new building designs in vulnerable  areas to be altered or moved when appropriate in the future. Com- munities can also plan for an eventual retreat from barrier islands and  coastal high hazard areas but, in the meantime, continue to invest  in assets in a limited fashion based on that assets expected lifetime  and projected inundation. It is important to note that communication  about retreat can be difficult. The language used to convey adaptation  strategies can make a difference in how communities react to propos- als. The term retreat often conveys a defeat, which can deter stake- holders from embracing the strategy. They may instead fight it. Other  possible terms to use include managed relocation and realign- ment. Home buyout programs, rolling easements, and land swaps are  a few possible mechanisms that communities can investigate in order  to implement managed retreat. There is also a growing body of case  law in this arena.", "274": "Avoidance involves guiding new development away from areas that  are subject to coastal hazards and can be done by implementing pol- icy and/or offering of incentives. Since capital infrastructure is devel- oped and maintained for a relatively long lifespan, planning for future  changes in sea level should be a part of initial design or incorporated  when plans are due for periodic update. City and County Land Devel- opment Regulations and Codes, as well as zoning regulations, can be  used to direct development and redevelopment to more suitable areas  where flooding and erosion are less troublesome. See Chapter 3.6 for  information about Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), another  strategy for avoidance.", "275": "Adaptation Action Areas  a State Planning Tool The designation of Adaptation  Action Areas (AAAs) is a compre- hensive planning tool that has been  available since 2011 with the pas- sage of the Community Planning  Act by the Florida legislature. An  optional but highly recommended  tool for adaptation strategies, AAAs  lend themselves to a flexible form  of zoning overlay that delineates  the physical areas where certain measures, restrictions, or prioritized  funding would apply. It is especially beneficial to designate AAAs now  because local agencies currently have the option to devise criteria  for their designation and the flexibility to edit them as circumstances  change. In many instances the 2018 FIRM update expands FEMA-des- ignated floodplains, however, in places where they are being reduced,  the need for AAAs is especially urgent. These areas are still vulnerable  to flooding, but property owners who have the option to drop flood  insurance will likely do so", "276": "Selection of Strategies In coordination with public input (which is described in greater detail in  Chapter 3.7), the planning team assesses the relative merits and costs  of each adaptation strategy within a given focus area to prioritize the  preferred adaptation strategy. This may be accomplished through a ben- efit-cost analysis, alternatives analysis, stakeholder feedback, or even  new output from a tool utilized during the Vulnerability Assessment.  Communities that have already gone through this process have also  identified the value of doing a business as usual baseline assessment18 that will help compare the costs anticipated by the adaptation strategies.  While adaptation strategies carry a cost, sometimes a significant one,  in the long run a benefit-cost analysis may show that properly planned  adaptation yields a tremendous savings as compared to doing nothing.", "277": "3.4. Integrate into Existing Plans Adaptation Planning outcomes are very effective when integrated into  specific local planning products. Below is a list of eight planning prod- ucts that may already exist in a local community that are appropriate  to amend with adaptation planning strategies.19 A Local Comprehensive Plan (LCP) is required of all Florida counties  and municipalities, guiding future growth and development. LCP pol- icies generally influence a communitys day-to-day land use decisions  and capital facilities expenditures. These policies play a major role in  determining local development patterns, which in turn determine the  degree to which people and property are exposed to natural hazards,  injury, and damage. Examples of communities who have already incor- porated AAAs in their LCP are included in Chapter 3.6, Best Practices. Florida local agencies are now required to integrate or add accom- modations for the 2015 Peril of Flood Statute [163.3178(2)(f) 1-6]  into their Local Comprehensive Plan. Signed into law by Governor Rick  Scott on May 21, 2015, this requirement should be contained in a new  or existing redevelopment component of their coastal management  planning element. This component should eliminate inappropriate and  unsafe development in the coastal areas when opportunities arise.", "278": "Much of the data analysis and mapping performed for a robust  response to the Peril of Flood requirement can also contribute to a  Vulnerability Assessment. The Local Mitigation Strategy (LMS) is usually developed at the county  level and serves to reduce the risks associated with natural and man- made disasters, including sea level rise. It is a connection between the  Local Comprehensive Plan, the emergency management plan, the cap- ital improvements plan, land development regulations, building codes,  and key ordinances such as those for floodplain management.  A Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) is a broad-reaching plan  providing for natural resource protection and reasonable coastal-de- pendent economic growth and contains a detailed and comprehensive  statement of policies, standards, and criteria to guide public and pri- vate uses of lands and waters as well as mechanisms for timely imple- mentation in specific geographic areas within the coastal zone. SAMPs  also provide for increased specificity in protecting natural resources,  improved protection of life and property in hazardous areas, including  those areas likely to be affected by sea level rise, as well as improved  predictability in government decision making. 16 USCS  1453 (17),  [Title 16. Conservation; Chapter 33. Coastal Zone Management]. An Economic Development Plan (EDP) provides an overview of the  economy, sets policy direction for economic growth, and identifies strat- egies, programs, and projects for improvement. These policies and strat- egies can guide future investment and economic growth or activities to  areas that are safe and that have reduced exposure to hazard risks. 20 Peril of Flood Statute. SB 1094, 2015. Florida 163.3178(2)(f) 1-6. Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 43 42 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook A post-disaster redevelopment plan (PDRP) is encouraged for all com- munities. A PDRP identifies policies, operational strategies, and roles  and responsibilities for implementation that will guide decisions that  affect long-term recovery and redevelopment of a community after a  disaster. PDRPs emphasize seizing opportunities for hazard mitigation  and community improvement consistent with the goals of the Local  Comprehensive Plan and with full participation of the citizens.  A capital improvements plan (CIP) guides the scheduling of spending  on public improvements, such as capital projects and equipment pur- chases. A CIP can serve as an important mechanism for guiding future  investments and improvements away from identified hazard areas. It  can be used to modify an existing project to add a mitigation/resilience  component. A stormwater management plan (SMP) is designed to address flood- ing associated with stormwater runoff. A stormwater management  plan is typically focused on design and construction measures that are  intended to reduce the impact of more frequently occurring but minor  (from a flooding standpoint) urban flooding that impacts water quality. A historic preservation plan (HPP) is intended to preserve historic  structures or districts within a community. An often-overlooked aspect  of the historic preservation plan is the assessment of buildings and  sites located in areas subject to natural hazards and the identification  of ways to reduce future damages.", "279": "Funding Opportunities Funding opportunities to complete adaptation planning or projects  can come from a variety of sources. DEP has a Coastal Partnership Ini- tiative with annual grant funding and the Clean Water State Revolving  fund provides access to low interest loans. DEO funds technical assis- tance grants for planning purposes. The EPA and FEMA have several  grant programs as well. See Appendix 6.2 for more details about spe- cific funding programs", "280": "3.7. Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation The Adaptation Strategies step is the most solution-based part of the  Adaptation Planning process. An extensive public involvement component  is appropriate for this point and should build off the findings of the Vulner- ability Assessment. Unique local solutions are only possible when people  with different expertise and interests come together and collaborate. Structured discussion will help guide collaboration and keep the con- versation on task and productive. It is possible to delve into great  depth on particular issues and this type of detail is not always appro- priate in settings with large numbers of attendees. Questionnaires sent  to participants before the workshops that ask about their goals and  expectations for the workshop can be especially helpful as is a second  questionnaire sent after the workshop to ask participants about how  they would like to make use of the Adaptation Plan in their respective  departments.23 As learned during the pilot community projects, local officials want  to better understand their options and constraints. Knowing both the  local context as well as what has been done in other parts of Florida will  enable local officials to make informed decisions. Information pertaining  to both is appropriate to include in public materials and discussions.", "281": "Once a set of adaptation strategies has been developed and analyzed, it  is time to transition to implementation activities to move the strategies  from plan to action. This process includes identifying, preparing for, and  applying for potential funding opportunities; creating a schedule of adap- tation actions for the future; and monitoring and evaluating progress. Implementation strategies are the specific steps a community takes to  incorporate the adaptation strategies into existing planning, budgeting,  and staffing mechanisms. The Assess Adaptive Capacities sub-com- ponent (Chapter 3.1) should outline the ability of the community to  take action. Even before the Vulnerability Assessment is conducted,  communities may want to consider possible implementation strate- gies based on available capacities, existing implementation schedules,  or available funding sources. Communities must be able to support  and implement adaptation activities to successfully reduce the neg- ative impacts of potential sea level rise that were identified during a  Vulnerability Assessment. The ability to implement can increase over  time, so communities should not simply settle for what is available at  the current time but expect that, as they undertake the first round of  implementation, their knowledge and capacity will grow. The Implementation Strategies component contains most of the adap- tation plans logistics  the actions and functions that need to take  place for the product (adaptation strategies) to be delivered. By care- fully aligning the schedule of activities to funding opportunities and  assigning groups who can competently prepare each of the adaptation  strategies for incorporation into their appropriate plan or physical loca-", "282": "4.1. Survey of Funding Options  It is recommended that a systematic review of all known funding  sources, as well as inquiry into new funding opportunities that may  facilitate a successful implementation strategy, be completed. The availability of funds is often a key determinant as to what activi- ties could be undertaken. Funding can originate at non-profit, private,  local, state, and federal levels. It may originate from a source such  as penny sales tax, tax-increment financing, cooperative banking, or  grants. Available grants often change, but the following list identifies  agencies that may offer grants to fund adaptation strategies as well as  past and current grant examples:   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  Office  for Coastal Management Broad Agency Announcement for  special projects   US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  P3 awards: A national  student design competition for sustainability   US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)   Community Development Block Grants Chapter 4: Implementation Strategies52 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook   Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)  Florida  Coastal Partnership Initiative   Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO)  Community  Resiliency Technical Assistance Grants   Local land conservation trusts (such as the Florida Keys Environ- mental Restoration Trust Fund) The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may also pro- vide several kinds of assistance to communities who have prepared  a local mitigation strategy that conforms to the standards set forth  in the Code of Federal Regulations (44 CR 201.6). If the community  has developed a hazard mitigation plan that is recognized by the State  (under Section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer- gency Act as amended April 2013), then some examples of applicable  FEMA funding that can be applied to coastal Protection, Accommoda- tion, and Retreat measures are as follows:   Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)   Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)   Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) FEMA makes the Hazard Mitigation Assistance guidance, which pro- vides the detailed information on these mitigation grant programs,  available annually. In some instances, funding can be obtained to assist  with the Vulnerability Assessment component also. Hazard Mitigation  Plans (known locally in Florida as the Local Mitigation Strategy or LMS),  which can be funded under HMGP and PDM, can also include Avoid- ance measures.", "283": "After major disasters, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment (HUD) can provide mitigation grants under its Community Devel- opment Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program when  Congress approves a disaster supplemental. The eligible activities vary  from disaster to disaster and would be provided in the Federal Register  notice along with the State Action Plan that must be developed. In addition, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), under  the US Department of Agriculture, has two programs that may be  available to communities: the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP)  Program and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention (WFPO)  Program. The EWP Program is a federal emergency recovery program  available after disasters and offers assistance to communities to relieve  imminent threats to life and property caused by natural disasters that  impair a watershed. The WFPO is a cooperative program between the  federal government, states, and locals to prevent floodwater and sed- iment damage and erosion and work towards conservation of water  and land in authorized watersheds. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity manages the Flor- ida Disaster Recovery Program and assists communities in develop- ing economic development strategies, meeting the requirements of  the Community Planning Act, addressing critical local planning issues,  and promoting innovative planning solutions to challenges identified  by local government applicants. Community Planning Technical Assis- tance Grants are for one fiscal year and are awarded on a cost-reim- bursement basis. Deliverables must be approved by the Bureau befor", "284": "money is disbursed. The grants provide communities the opportunity  to develop innovative planning and development strategies to pro- mote a diverse economy, create vibrant rural and suburban areas,  and meet the requirements of the Community Planning Act while pro- tecting environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, the community  is encouraged to brainstorm innovative local funding ideas and plan  activities to build awareness and capacity for self-directed programs. If  a community identifies a lack of funding, a key consideration in assess- ing management priorities may be to identify and develop additional  funding resources", "285": "4.1.1. Prioritize Strategies Once a community has identi- fied Protection, Accommodation,  Retreat, and Avoidance strategies,  it may prioritize actions within its  Focus Areas. Funding should be  prioritized for adaptation activ- ities and actions, reducing risk  in the most cost-efficient way. It is important to maintain a balance  between the urgency of the moment to address current risks while  showing foresight to plan for future impacts. In several instances, it is a  minimal cost to add an additional safety margin to a project which will  also help maintain the projects effectiveness as vulnerability and risk  may increase over time. Keep in mind that many facilities and infra- structure are built to last 30 to 50 years, if not longer, and future risk  Different types of prioritization  reflect where the urgency is,  community acceptance, and  what can get the biggest bang  for the buck. It is better to  establish the criteria upfront. Chapter 4: Implementation Strategies54 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook in the latter stages of developments useful life should be factored.  Consideration of all possible options and the related costs and benefits  of each will allow for a no-regrets strategy to be designed. Priorities should be based on risks identified and potential losses as  a result of those risks and reviewed in relation to funding, ability to  implement, and consistency with other plans. FEMA and NOAA (2013)  have developed a comprehensive but quick checklist of considerations  known as STAPLEE that help evaluate each proposed action:24   Social  What are the socially acceptable adaptation strategies in  the community?   Technical  What are the technically feasible adaptation strategies  within the community?   Administrative  Which adaptation strategies are implementable  by community leadership?   Political  Which adaptation strategies are politically acceptable  within the community?   Legal  Which adaptation strategies are legally implementable by  the community under state and municipal law?   Economic  What are the cost-effective adaptation strategies avail- able to the community?   Environmental  Which adaptation strategies are most favorable  to the environment as determined by community conservation  plans and statewide guidance? By using the STAPLEE categories, a community may prioritize adapta- tion strategies that meet local capacity and preferences. The STAPLEE  method can evaluate costs in relation to benefits of implementing  one particular action over another. Using STAPLEE serves as a reality  check that helps communities avoid putting too much effort into a  type of action that has little chance of success due its particular cir- cumstances, preferences, history, and culture. An informal cost-benefit analysis can also be used to review proposed  adaptation actions. Ratings of high, medium, or low can be assigned  to the anticipated costs and the benefits associated with each action  based on general criteria that are established by the community.  Examples of ratings could include criteria such as:    High cost  existing funding is not adequate.    Medium cost  existing funding would require budget reapportionment  or amendment.   Low cost  funding available under existing budget.   High benefit  action would have a significant impact on risk reduction.   Medium benefit  action would have an impact on risk reduction.   Low benefit  long-term benefits are difficult to quantify in short term.", "286": "This methodology provides a framework for the  overall costs and benefits of each action to be con- sidered when setting priorities. As described in  Chapter 3, there are situations where the impacts  from sea level rise are significant and already  present or imminent that may warrant taking on  the bigger challenges in the near term even if all  the funding needed is not presently identified.  Prioritization enhances the impact of Focus Area- driven adaptation strategies by ensuring that  the community adds additional aspects to the  comprehension of coastal flooding in the greater  context and functioning of the community.", "287": "4.2. Create a Schedule of Activities, Actions,  and Actors Creating a Schedule of Activities, Actions, and Actors takes the sec- ond half of implementation into account  providing impetus to the  actions to be completed and the agency/department/staff responsi- ble for each action. This sub-component can serve to program differ- ent types of adaptation activities according to their prioritized need  (see Chapters 3.2 and 4.1.1) and, in pairing with funding opportunities,  generate a concise and easy-to-follow plan. To create a schedule that is flexible yet delegates responsibility, the  planning team should identify the appropriate responsible party who  has the ability to complete a task, activity, or strategy.25 The plan- ning team may then schedule their monitoring and evaluation (see  Chapter 4.3) to follow up with the responsible local staff member.  Scheduling transfers responsibility to the implementing entity to  set and maintain timelines while ensuring that a coordinating group  remains informed and responsive to the activity as it is carried out  and later evaluated. However, due to the multi-disciplinary approach  needed to undertake many adaptation measures, it is recommended  that support personnel be assigned to projects to assist the primary  with the additional skill sets, knowledge base, and contacts needed to  successfully implement a project. Scheduling activities and assigning staff may emphasize the util- ity of planning ahead as the various elements of the schedule come  online. By naming the person or group responsible for each activitys  implementation, more accurate timelines can be made which may  economize the implementation process. As discussed in Chapter 3.4,  integrating adaptation into existing plans, if the strategy involves incor- porating activities into a regulatory document, provides an opportu- nity to program capacity building measures. For this sub-component,  the planning team is encouraged to consider consultants outside of  local government staff. A diverse set of participants within the steering  committee could connect individuals or entities from a wide berth in  the private sector, non-profits, and universities.", "288": "4.5. Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation Outreach can be one of the most important activities within a program  because it can lead to municipal action in the future. Increased stake- holder engagement throughout the adaptation planning process can  help to create buy-in amongst the public which can then in turn lead  to greater political support for adaptation actions in the community.  Holding public meetings, forums, or workshops that include business  groups, residents, and other community stakeholders can provide an  opportunity to educate participants and receive feedback based on  their understanding of local vulnerabilities to sea level rise and poten- tial responses. It can also be used as an opportunity to establish a con- nection between incremental improvements to citizen and property  safety and welfare and a more desirable future community. Participatory monitoring efforts can help the community observe  unanticipated coastal flooding impacts and effects of adaptation strat- egies. Stakeholder feedback can be used to gauge community satisfac- tion with adaptation strategies and their implementation and provide  a forum for addressing new concerns as they arise. These two partic- ipatory activities will continue after the initial planning effort is com- plete and may be integrated with other ongoing monitoring and evalu- ation mechanisms to ensure that continued attention is paid to them.  Communities should establish a long-term, simple feedback mecha- nism whereby individuals may express new concerns or developments  about the selected adaptation projects. In addition, some adaptation  projects (usually environmental) involve a degree of monitoring. Com- munity members may be willing to volunteer their time to observe if  the desired effects are occurring and even to provide maintenance and  upkeep labor.", "289": "Resilience has many definitions, but in the context of this guidebook,  it means the ability of a community to prepare for and adapt to the  effects of sea level rise, especially coastal flooding, erosion, and eco- system changes.

For a more thorough discussion of how  to integrate stakeholder participation, a number of  useful Key Resources are suggested at the end of this  chapter.

The table of phenomena, impacts, and consequences  in Chapter 2 provides a national overview of the  climate change phenomena expected to be of greatest  importance in coastal regions.  These phenomena are:  Rising Sea Levels  Declining Great Lake Levels  Increasing Storm Intensity/Frequency  Changing Precipitation Patterns  Increasing Air Temperature   Increasing Water Temperature  Ocean Acidification Because of the strong regional variations in most of  these phenomena, and based on the scope of the  plan, the planning team will need to decide which  phenomena to include in its vulnerability assessment.  There are a number of resources available to help with  this decision and to provide input into other steps of  this assessment. The U.S. Global Climate Research  Programs Global Climate Change Impacts in the United  States, which contains information about potential  impacts by region and is the authoritative source on  climate change science and impacts in the United States,  provides a good starting point. Other good resources  for existing projections include research institutions  (especially Sea Grant institutions), regional climate  centers, state climatologists, and NOAA Regional  Integrated Sciences and Assessments programs.  From this research, the planning team should be able  to collect preliminary information about the climate  change phenomena that may affect the states coast in  the future.

While this  guide categorizes them by phenomenon, you may  choose to approach them differently (e.g., by impact,  sector, or type of environmentnatural vs. built).  Based on the phenomena identified in Step 2.1, the  planning team will identify the associated impacts and  consequences. The resources consulted in Step 2.1  and the information in Chapter 2 and Appendix C can  provide an idea of these impacts. Many, if not all, of  these impacts will have been experienced in the past  and are likely to be exacerbated by climate change.  The planning team may choose to address all of these  impacts, and others, or may choose to limit them based  on the scope of the plan.

As data are collected  about natural resources, the planning team may want  to consider attributes of these systems that provide  a sense of how vulnerable they may be to climate  change and, thus, which systems may need the most  assistance preparing for and responding to climate  change.

Their main shortcomings are limited  observations, incomplete understanding of climate  processes and their interrelationships, imperfect model  representations of the processes, and relatively large  grid boxes that dont represent smaller terrain features  (Meted 2009). It is important to recognize these  deficiencies, understand the uncertainties, and consider  results from multiple models, as well as how results  track with observations, to account for the range of  uncertainty and variability among them.  To model climate change in your state, consider  1) using the results of the scenarios generated for  2100 for the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Report7 and adjusting global projections to account for local  conditions (e.g., add local subsidence projections  to global sea level rise projections) and to estimate  shorter-term projections or 2) downscaling global  climate data. Since global climate models have relatively coarse  spatial resolution, downscaling is required to achieve  the finer spatial resolution needed to understand  regional impacts.

They will vary based on a number  of factors, such as the type and magnitude of  projected climate change impacts and the vulnerable  assets as identified in the vulnerability assessment.  Other important factors include the availability of  financial, technical, and human resources and the  states acceptable level of impacts. Goals should  be clearly written, attainable, and measurable  (qualitatively or quantitatively).  After reviewing the vulnerability assessment  findings, a good starting point for goal setting is  to review goals established in other state plans/ programs (e.g., those for coastal management,  hazard mitigation2, emergency operations,  environmental preservation, economic development,  resource management, transportation, etc.).  Adaptation plans from other governments, state and  local, are also useful resources. Some of these plans  can be accessed online at http://collaborate.csc .noaa.gov/climateadaptation/.", "324": "Step 3.2: Identify Actions Since many of the impacts and consequences of  climate change are not new, simply exacerbated or  accelerated, actions to reduce them already exist and  are being implemented outside the context of climate  change. This chapter illustrates how familiar actions  can also be used to support climate change adaptation. However, some of these actions are likely insufficient  for addressing the scale of the potential changes. It  will take a combination of existing, reconfigured, and  new actions to meet the challenges of climate change.  Importantly, the potential impacts of climate change on  the coast should be considered in all related planning,  law and policy making, and investment activities.", "325": "While reviewing state plans for possible goals,  also look at the actions and consider the following  questions in regard to actions along the coast as well  as elsewhere in the watershed:  Are there any actions that directly address  climate change impacts along the coast?   Are there any actions that indirectly address  climate change impacts along the coast?  Are there any actions that could or should  be modified to help meet the goals of the  adaptation plan?   Are there any actions that are in direct conflict  with the goals of the adaptation plan? To ensure the plan is inclusive of all actions that  may affect your coast and to avoid duplication, you  may want to consider incorporating ongoing and  already planned activities in your plan. Additionally,  there may be actions that could be modified to meet  multiple purposes with shared resources. If there are  actions that might hinder efforts to meet adaptation  goals, try to work with the entity responsible for that  action to reach a mutually beneficial solution. As  mentioned before, coordination and collaboration  among other state agencies and stakeholders is  critical, both to capitalize on each others efforts  and to avoid conflicts that could prove difficult and  expensive to overcome in the future. Think broadly and do not be afraid to think big. Do  not worry about resource or technology constraints,  these issues will be raised during the evaluation  process, which will help the planning team narrow  down the list and prioritize the agreed upon actions.  Hold on to the list of actions that do not make the  initial cut. In the future, some of these actions may be  more appropriate and/or feasible. Finally, be creative. Actions can be built to encompass one or more  measures (see examples in the table on page 51) and  should be crafted so they can be clearly understood  (e.g., does the action involve planning, promoting,  encouraging, mandating, constructing, etc.). While not  all of the measures included here can be implemented  at the state level, they are examples of activities states  can support and promote to local governments. A  lot of climate change adaptation will take place at the  local level, and financial and technical assistance from  higher levels of government, as well as mandates, in  some instances, will be vital to secure the necessary  level of local commitment. Not all actions included in this guide will be suitable  for every situation. One action may be appropriate  in one location but not in another. Suitability will  depend on circumstances specific to each state and its  ", "326": "coastal zone and may require additional research, study,  legal review, and legislative or regulatory change.  ", "327": "Planning, Law Making, and Regulating A number of measures can be used to alleviate many  of the impacts and consequences of climate change  and will be critical to successful climate change  adaptation efforts. Importantly, these measures include  planning, law making, and regulating. Adaptation  will require new, and modifications to existing, plans,  laws, and regulations. Going forward, all planning and  rulemaking activities should consider climate change  and future conditions so outcomes support, and do not  deter, adaptation efforts. Measures listed in the table on page 51 and discussed  further at the end of the chapter are more likely to be  acceptable and effective if they result from a traditional  planning process such as the one presented in this  guide. These measures can be incorporated into the  adaptation planning process or that of an existing plan  (e.g., comprehensive, hazard mitigation, watershed  management, capital improvement, etc.). Alternatively,  the planning team may decide a measure requires its  own plan (e.g., because of scope or complexity).  One type of plan encouraged by the Coastal Zone  Management Act is the Special Area Management  Plan (SAMP). SAMPs are broadly defined in the act  as plans which provide for increased specificity in  protecting significant natural resources, reasonable  coastal dependent economic growth, improved  protection of life and property in hazardous areas,  including those areas likely to be affected by land  subsidence, sea level rise, or fluctuating water levels  of the Great Lakes, and improved predictability in  governmental decision making (CZMA 1972). SAMPs  and other plans with similar intents are especially  appropriate in areas where authorities overlap and  coordination and cooperation is required to effectively  address the multitude of needs that have arisen along  the coasts. Many local governments, and some states, have  comprehensive plans to guide development. Some  states require local governments to have such plans;  others provide incentives that encourage them. In  ", "328": "either case, states typically specify the elements that  should be included in local comprehensive plans. For  the purposes of adaptation, a new adaptation element  could be specified, adaptation measures could be  incorporated into existing elements (e.g., land use,  transportation, environment, natural hazards, etc.),  as appropriate, or local adaptation plans could be  incorporated by reference. In addition, to address  climate change, the timeframe of comprehensive  plans may need to extend further into the future.  Incorporating adaptation into local comprehensive  plans in some way lends them the strength of internal  consistency, which is required by some states, to ensure  local actions are taken based upon and consistent with  the legally adopted comprehensive plan. Research on local comprehensive plans as vehicles  for reducing insured losses in natural disasters  suggests that comprehensive plans that include hazard  mitigation can reduce such losses: losses are lower  in states that require comprehensive plans and even  more so in those that require comprehensive plans  to address hazards. However, research also suggests  that in the absence of a state mandate to prepare a  comprehensive plan and address hazards, the planning  efforts of many local governments are inadequate  (Burby 2005). While mandates may result in plans, they may not  have the desired effect if they do not consider existing  barriers to effective planning and/or if the plans are  not effectively implemented.3 When issuing or revising  a state mandate, consider the role of the state in the  oversight process and how it can enforce and monitor  plan implementation as well as development and content  (while maintaining flexibility for local decision making). Since plans are typically not legally binding,  governments may pass laws and ordinances and issue  implementing regulations to best achieve the desired  outcomes identified through the planning process,  especially when it comes to land use. The Second  National Assessment on Natural and Related Technological  Hazards states No single approach to bringing  sustainable hazard mitigation into existence shows  more promise at this time than increased use of sound  and equitable land-use management (Mileti 1999).

In this task, the planning  team will decide which of the actions identified in  the previous step are actually suitable for the states  unique set of circumstances and then prioritize them  for implementation. Decisions will need to be made;  difficult tradeoffs may be required. Much of this  discussion is based on FEMAs Developing the Mitigation  Plan: Identifying Actions and Implementing Strategies (2003). One way to evaluate the proposed actions is to  use a method that considers the Social, Technical,  Administrative, Political, Legal, Economic, and  Environmental (STAPLEE) opportunities and  constraints of each action. The information the  planning team generates from this evaluation process  will help them weigh the pros and cons of each action  to determine which are best for the state. There are  no right or wrong answers. The criteria are defined as  follows:  SocialThe action should be socially  acceptable.   Will the proposed action  disproportionately affect (positively or  negatively) one segment of the population? Actions will need to be evaluated based on criteria established  by the planning team and, once selected, prioritized for  implementation.  Is the action compatible with present and  future community values?  TechnicalThe action should be technically  feasible, help to reduce losses in the long term,  and have minimal cumulative and secondary  impacts.   How effective is the action in avoiding or  reducing future losses?  Will it create more problems than it solves?  Does it solve the problem or only address a  symptom?  AdministrativeThe action should be  implementable by the state. Can the state meet  the staffing and funding needs of the action or  will it need outside assistance?   Does the state have the capacity (staff,  technical expertise, and funding) to  implement and maintain the action, or can  it be realistically obtained elsewhere?  PoliticalThe action should be politically  acceptable.   Is there political support to implement and  maintain this action?  Is there a champion willing to help see the  action to completion?  Is there enough public support to ensure  the success of the action?  LegalThe state must have the legal authority  to implement/enforce the action.   Does the state have the authority to  implement/enforce the action?  Are the proper laws and regulations in place  to implement/enforce the action?  Are there any potential legal consequences?  Will the state be liable for the action or lack  of action?  Is the action likely to be challenged by  stakeholders who may be negatively  affected?  EconomicThe action should be cost- effective and be likely to pass a benefit-cost  analysis.  Are there currently sources of funds that  can be used to implement the action?", "336": "What benefits (market and nonmarket)  will the action provide?  Does the cost seem reasonable for the  size of the problem and likely benefits?  What burden will be placed on the tax  base or local economy to implement this  action?  Does the action contribute to or detract  from other community economic  goals, such as capital improvements or  economic development?  What are the economic consequences of  not implementing the action?  EnvironmentalThe action should meet  statutory considerations and public desire  for sustainable and environmentally healthy  communities.  How will the action affect the  environment (land, water, protected  species)?  Will the action comply with state  and federal environmental laws and  regulations?  Is the action consistent with state  environmental goals? Once the planning team has decided on the  acceptable actions given review of the criteria above  (or a different set of criteria), it should prioritize the  actions for implementation.

In this guide, outreach  is the provision of information to all stakeholders  (anyone who will be affected by climate change  in your state), and education involves the formal  education system (typically kindergarten through  grade 12).  Purposes of outreach can include engaging  stakeholders in the planning effort, gaining support  for planning and action implementation, informing  the public about climate change and their role in  adaptation, communicating the benefits of natural  resources and ways to protect them, and changing  attitudes and behaviors. Outreach is not a one-time  activity. It should begin with the launching of the  adaptation planning effort and continue throughout  the process (as introduced in Chapter 3) and as  Using visuals to explain how coastal areas may be impacted  by climate change can build support for adaptation.  new information becomes available, milestones are  met, successes become evident, and whenever an  appropriate opportunity presents itself (e.g., when  the plan is released or when adaptation actions are  implemented that require support, adherence, or  assistance). There are numerous challenges to communicating  about climate change. The uncertainty of the  science and the presence of more immediate issues  are perhaps the biggest. While a few resources for  helping conduct outreach and craft and deliver  adaptation messages are noted at the end of the  chapter, the planning team should consider enlisting  communications specialists to help in this endeavor.  An outreach strategy can help guide climate change  adaptation communications and, similar to the  strategy for an adaptation plan, should identify goals  and actions to ensure stakeholders are being reached  in an effective manner. An outreach strategy involves  identifying the target population, conducting a  population profile (so the best way to communicate  with them is understood), crafting the message, and  then deciding how to disseminate it. There will likely  be multiple stakeholder groups/target populations  (e.g., planning team members and other participating  stakeholders, the general public, state and local elected  officials and other decision makers, developers,  resource managers, etc.) who may require tailored  messages and different delivery formats. ", "350": "As the strategy is drafted, the planning team should  consider what is already being done to reach the  target populations. Can climate change adaptation  be incorporated into existing government programs  for climate change mitigation, coastal management,  emergency management, public health, water  conservation, stormwater management, etc.? What  communications vehicles are planning team members  already using? Are there lessons learned that the  planning team can benefit from? As appropriate,  coordinate outreach efforts with federal activities,  including National Flood Safety Awareness Week,  Hurricane Preparedness Week, American Wetlands  Month, and others. Be prepared to take advantage of  windows of opportunity, which may come in the form  of extreme weather events (in your state or elsewhere);  the arrival of climate conditions that may affect your  state (e.g., annual storm seasons, El Nio, La Nia);  national media attention, etc. Effective communication has to achieve a match  between message content, framing, and the concerns  and values with which audiences resonate (Bostrom  and Lashof 2007). When communicating with the  public, consider geographic, socioeconomic, and  cultural differences. Who is most vulnerable? What  languages do they speak? What are their interests?  Surveys can help inform the planning team about  how stakeholders feel about climate change and  adaptation and what they value most and may help it  better understand how to engage them on the subject.  For instance, if some stakeholders have doubts about  climate change, or the term itself is too politically  charged, taking an approach that focuses on the impacts  and consequences, many of which they may have  already experienced or are familiar with, may be more  effective.4  A demonstration of the trends can illustrate  the need to take action.

By supporting pilot projects,  the state will be able to test out adaptation measures  in a limited number of communities before applying  them statewide. Financial assistance could also be  provided through incentives, where special funds are  only available where prerequisites established by the  state have been met.

Once again,  survey the planning team to see what programs already  exist. Could adaptation be incorporated into them or  could their focus be shifted? Training advances outreach efforts and, as with  outreach, will likely have multiple target populations  and messages. Each program should address the  individual needs of the target population, which  could be elected officials; state and local planners,  natural resource managers, or building code officials;  developers; marine contractors; the general public; etc.  For example, a training program to educate elected  officials about their role in climate change adaptation  would look very different from a program designed to  teach marine contractors about living shorelines.  Many local governments already provide map  information services, where they respond to inquiries  regarding the location of a property in relation to  special flood hazard areas as well as its base flood  elevation. However, due to both financial and  technical constraints, this information may be limited  to information on a Digital Flood Insurance Rate  Map. Should the state expand mapping activities to  better capture the location of natural resources and  identify areas susceptible to other coastal hazards,  this information could be passed along (e.g., as GIS  overlays) to local governments to better inform their  map information service as well as their planning  efforts. In addition, this information could be used as  input to a coast-wide web mapping application that  would allow local governments and other stakeholders  to view the location of hazard-prone and natural areas.  In addition to providing data, maps, and models,  which will help lay the foundation for an adaptation  plan, the state can further support the planning  activities of local governments by providing  planning guidance, such as a local version of this  document customized for your state.

A robust planning program is essential to effectively  manage growth and development, and it is widely  recognized that land use planning is an effective way  to reduce risks associated with natural hazards (Burby  1998). While most growth will be managed locally,  there is still a role for the state to play, including  restricting growth where it affects state lands and  offering assistance and disincentives (e.g., not providing  funding for infrastructure or other services that will  encourage growth in inappropriate areas) to local  governments.

A number of the measures discussed in this  guide can be implemented through zoning.  Zoning can be used to regulate parcel use, density of  development, building dimensions, setbacks, impervious  surfaces, type of construction (e.g., easily movable),  shore protection structures, landscaping, etc. It can also  be used to regulate where development can and cannot  take place, making it an invaluable tool in efforts to  protect natural resources and environmentally sensitive  areas and guide development away from hazard-prone  areas. Permissible uses and standards vary by zoning  district. Types of districts include general use districts;  overlay districts, where provisions in addition to those  on the underlying districts apply; and special use  districts, in which all uses require permits.  Floodplain zoning is an example of a zoning application  that, if thoughtfully drafted, can provide multiple  benefits. In addition to protecting life and property,  benefits of floodplain zoning can include resource  conservation, open space preservation, public access,  and water-quality protection. Floodplain regulations that  just meet the minimum requirements of the National  Flood Insurance Program are more focused on how to  build safely in the floodplain and may not provide the  additional benefits", "357": "As the climate changes, adjustments will need to be  made. Zoning regulations will need to be adaptive.  Current regulations may need to be revised to  accommodate for new conditions. For example,  regulations that limit building height may need to be  altered in light of changing elevation requirements.  Your state may want to encourage local governments  to review the adequacy of their zoning, make changes  and additions as appropriate, and to consider climate  change in future zoning decisions. As the need for  new districts arises, model language can help ease the  process and advance state interests.

A building lost to one  storm is likely to be lost to another if built back  on its prestorm footprint and without significant  structural improvements. Despite the desire to  return to prestorm conditions, it is important  to build back right. Combining restrictions with  acquisition/demolition/relocation programs  provides safer options to property owners in the  wake of the loss of or damage to their homes or  businesses. Such restrictions will likely be more  acceptable if adopted prior to a disaster rather than  during recovery.  Restrictions could apply to repetitive losses or  severe repetitive losses as defined by FEMA, or  they could apply to any structure in a particular  area (e.g., the 100- or 500-year floodplain) that is  destroyed or substantially damaged. A prohibition  on redevelopment of structures destroyed or  substantially damaged by storms or chronic erosion  would serve multiple purposes. It would protect  life and property by removing them from harms  way and allow the natural and beneficial functions  of the floodplain to return. However, an outright  prohibition is often politically and practically  difficult to implement (though less so when public", "359": "health or access is at stake). Restrictions that attach  provisions to reconstruction, such as siting, design, and  construction requirements, are often more achievable. At a minimum, where rebuilding is allowed, general  permitting requirements for new construction  should be enforced, including for those structures  that were nonconforming prior to their loss.  In addition, rebuilding after a loss provides an  opportunity to include additional measures that will  better protect the building and the land on which it  resides", "360": "Conservation Easements A conservation easement is a legal agreement between  a landowner and a land trust or government agency  that can be used to restrict development in sensitive  and hazard-prone areas.

Landowners can sell or donate their easement.  Easements that are sold are also known as PDRs  (purchase of development rights). Landowners who  donate their easement may be eligible for federal  or state tax breaks. Easements typically apply in  perpetuity and are passed on from owner to owner.  Most are placed on individual properties, but they  may also be placed on subdivisions or coordinated  at a regional scale (e.g., to more effectively manage a  strip of shoreline or accommodate beach and wetland  migration).

It is  a pattern of development that aims to use land  more efficiently by grouping a mixed-use of buildings  together, minimizing their collective footprint, and  leaving undeveloped land in its natural state.8  More  open space and fewer impervious surfaces means  reduced runoff and flooding. It also means reduced  investments in services and infrastructure design,  construction, and maintenance. Compact communities  are also known for their walkability, thus compact  community design also helps mitigate climate change. The high density development suggested by compact  community design can allow for more opportunities  to guide development away from sensitive and hazard- prone areas, but without proper planning, it can lead  to increased susceptibility to hazards. Any such design  must still consider the location of hazard-prone  areas as well as the location and carrying capacity of  evacuation routes. Compact community design is best  implemented in conjunction with zoning ordinances  that regulate development in hazard-prone areas and  strong building codes.", "363": "Along heavily developed coastlines, compact  community design may be difficult to implement  since little undeveloped open land will be available.

Generally, acquisition is  the best and most cost-effective hazard mitigation  alternative because it permanently removes people  and their homes from harms way (FEMA 1998). In  addition, it can reduce the emotional and financial  costs associated with response and recovery from  future storms, reduce flooding by restoring natural  floodplain functions and increasing flood storage  area, and support environmental and public access/ recreational goals.  While acquisition serves multiple purposes, this  discussion focuses on the acquisition of land  and associated structures that are vulnerable to  natural hazards.

Factors involved  in the decision to demolish or relocate may include  cost-effectiveness (some structures are easier and  cheaper to move than others), condition of the  structures, property owner interests, availability of  land for relocation, etc. Acquisition/demolition  projects are typically easier to implement than  acquisition/relocation projects. It is a good idea to plan for acquisition by identifying  and prioritizing properties and structures for  acquisition. Target properties may include:  Properties that have suffered multiple losses  (e.g., repetitive loss and severe repetitive loss  properties)  Properties with structures that are  substantially damaged or destroyed  Properties (with and without structures) that  are in an identified hazard-prone area (e.g.,  floodway, sea level rise inundation area, special  flood hazard area, erosion hazard area)  Hazard-prone properties for which retrofitting  (e.g., elevating) is not cost-effective  Properties in potential wetland migration  corridors", "366": "Setbacks While setback and buffer regulations as described  in this guide are similar in effect, they differ in  purpose. The discussion here focuses on the use  of setbacks largely for the purpose of protecting  structures from hazards by keeping the structures  away from a propertys most vulnerable areas. As  such, they are closely tied to other regulations that  manage development in hazard-prone areas, such  as redevelopment, floodplain management, and  shore protection structure regulations. Subdivision  regulations can require lots to be deep enough  to accommodate initial setbacks as well as future  relocations. And, building codes can ensure  structures can be moved with relative ease. Setbacks may be regulated at the state or local level, or  both, and may be based on size or use. Typically, they  require structures to be sited at a distance measured  inland from a specific shoreline feature, such as a high  water mark, vegetation line, dune toe, or bluff crest.  This distance may be a fixed number of feet (e.g., 100  feet) or may be based on the long-term annual rate of  erosion (e.g., 30 times the long-term annual rate of  erosion). Fixed numbers may not be adequate in highly  erosive areas and may be too restrictive in others; and  setbacks based on long-term average annual rates of  erosion do not currently account for how erosion  rates will change as sea level rises.

Increased structural wind-resistance can  be achieved by adhering to special design techniques,  using stronger, more wind-resistant materials and  connections, such as hurricane clips and the bracing  of gabled roofs; and protecting openings with impact- resistant materials or shutters", "371": "Retrofitting Although recent improvements in construction  practices and regulations have made new structures  less hazard-prone, many existing structures remain  vulnerable and will likely be more so as climate  changes. And, as these changes are realized and codes  evolve to keep up with them, even structures built to or  above current codes are likely to become threatened. Existing structures can be protected from hazards  through retrofitting.12 While retrofitting may not  bring a structure up to code (unless required during  a substantial improvement), it does help existing  structures better withstand hazard events and may  reduce insurance premiums. Retrofitting techniques  exist for a number of hazards, including floods and  high winds, and many of them are similar to those  required in the construction of new structures.  Examples include:  Elevating or floodproofing flood-prone  structures   Reinforcing and bracing roofs and garage doors  Anchoring homes to their foundations  Installing shutters on windows and other glass  openings  Removing impervious surfaces  Replacing exterior building components with  stronger, more hazard-resistant alternatives Since retrofitting is typically not required, homeowners  may not be aware of what they can do to protect  their homes and themselves.

Since infrastructure is  critical to the functioning of a healthy community, it  must be sited, designed, constructed, and maintained  so the provision of services continues uninterrupted.  Infrastructure protection entails fortification against  the impacts of climate change and, in some cases,  shoring up of capacity. While many of the ideas discussed under building  codes and retrofitting also apply to infrastructure, the  value of infrastructure, both socially and economically,  suggests the need for stricter requirements for new  infrastructure construction (e.g., plan for the 500-year  event, rather than the 100-year event) and a more  concerted effort to retrofit existing facilities and  systems. Roads, bridges, water and power utilities,  stormwater systems, and other infrastructure that  are already worn or overcapacity are likely to be  most vulnerable to climate change.13 Addressing and  correcting existing deficiencies needs to be a priority  and should be handled concurrently with adjustments  necessary to meet projected future conditions and  needs. Similarly, adaptation should be considered and  incorporated into regular maintenance and upgrade  activities. In general, designing for the future is less expensive  than retrofitting, rebuilding, or moving infrastructure.  When planning for new infrastructure, siting should  be the first consideration. Facilities and system  components should not be constructed in hazard- prone (current or projected) or valuable natural  resource areas, where possible, or in areas that would  encourage undesirable growth. When avoiding these  areas is not possible, efforts should be made to design  and construct facilities and system components to the  highest level of protection feasible in a manner that  allows for flexibility and future modifications.", "374": "Shore Protection Structures Shore protection structures protect existing  development allowing it to stay in place. However,  they often damage or destroy other valuable coastal  resources (economic, ecological, recreational, and  aesthetic), require substantial expenditure (initial  design and construction and maintenance), and create  a false sense of security. They may also encourage  additional development. Shore protection structures  provide an immediate fix that may not be sustainable.  Nevertheless, it is understood that in some cases,  for the purposes of protecting existing (not future)  development, there may be no other acceptable or  practical options. Alternatives to shore protection  structures are discussed in the Shoreline Management  category that follows.  Shore protection structures are designed to reduce  flooding/inundation and erosion of land and protect  structures and infrastructure. Despite the name, the  intent is to protect the built environment and the land  it sits on rather than the shore itself. 13 Onsite sewage disposal systems will also be vulnerable as sea levels rise and their separation from groundwater becomes inadequate.  Learning from othersMassachusetts Considers  Sea Level Rise in Infrastructure Siting In the 1990s, the Massachusetts Water Resources  Agency designed and built Bostons Deer Island  wastewater treatment plant in consideration of sea  level rise. Specifically, the plant was built 1.9 feet  higher than required at the time to accommodate  the amount of sea level rise projected to occur over  the expected lifetime of the facility (~50 years). And,  in a nod to climate change mitigation, the plant  gets approximately one-quarter of its power needs  through on-site renewable energy sources.  www.mwra.com/03sewer/html/sewditp.htm78 A Planning Guide for State Coastal Managers Most shore protection structures are built parallel or  perpendicular to the shoreline:   Shore parallel (seawalls, revetments, bulkheads,  breakwaters, rip rap)These structures help  hold the land back from the sea and the sea  back from the land and/or dissipate wave  energy.   Shore perpendicular (groins, jetties)These  structures interrupt sediment transport and  trap sediment to build/rebuild beaches and/or  stabilize navigational channels and inlets.  While they may be successful at meeting the level of  protection they are designed for, all of these structures  disrupt the natural flow of sediment, which may result  in the loss of the natural shoreline, coastal habitat, and  the associated ecosystem services and amenities, either  directly in front of the structure or in adjacent areas.  With the exception of breakwaters, which are built  offshore, shore parallel structures also inhibit the ability  of wetlands to migrate inland as sea level rises and may  interfere with public access. In most cases, protection in  one area will lead to losses in another (or the demand for  more shore protection structures), both to the built and  the natural environment. Large flood control systems like dikes (levees) and  movable gates and barriers (e.g., Maeslantkering in  the Netherlands and the Thames River Barrier in the  United Kingdom) are also being considered as viable  defenses against sea level rise. These structures require  significant investment and come with their own set of  concerns and adverse impacts.  When there are no suitable alternatives, future  shore protection structures should be designe", "375": "Regulation and Removal of Shore Protection  Structures As previously discussed, the use of shore protection  structures is only supported as an action of last resort  to protect valuable real estate and infrastructure. They  often do more harm to the natural shoreline than  good. To protect the natural shoreline and the benefits  it provides, states can use regulations to limit shoreline  hardening as well as to promote alternative forms of  protection and to encourage development that reduces  the needs for shore protection structures.  Regulations can specify allowable uses, locations,  and structures, prohibit new structures, and/or  require the removal of existing structures given  specified circumstances (e.g., no longer maintained,  substantially damaged, need to return land to  natural functions, etc.). The size, design, and  placement of shoreline stabilization structures can  also be regulated to minimize environmental and  public access impacts. Regulations that severely  restrict the use of shore protection structures or  require their removal should also require disclosure  of such restrictions in real estate transactions.", "376": "Rolling Easements Rolling easements are shoreline easements designed to  promote the natural migration of shorelines. Typically,  rolling easements prohibit shore protection structures,  which interfere with natural shoreline processes and  movement, but allow other types of development  and activities. As the sea rises, the easement, which  is usually delineated by a physical characteristic such  as the line of vegetation, moves or rolls landward,  sediment transport and wetland migration occur as  nature intended, and public access to the shore is  preserved. Since rolling easements reflect changing  conditions, they are likely to be a more effective  response to the impacts of climate change than  traditional zoning, which is based on conditions at the  time of the rule making. Rolling easements, which may be donated, purchased,  or regulated, place no restrictions on development.  They allow landowners to build anywhere on their  property with the understanding that they will not be  able to hold back the sea by armoring their shoreline  or deny public access. Once the shoreline has eroded  to a point where a privately owned structure is on  public land, a threat to human health and safety,  and/or threatened by flooding and erosion, that  structure should be relocated.

The mitigation of climate change  by reducing greenhouse gas emissions may be the best  response as adaptation may not be feasible.

While there is considerable scientific confidence in  support of activities that reduce nonclimate stressors,  the effectiveness of the measures discussed here in  helping systems adapt to climate change is not as  evident, and their consideration, while still essential,  requires a clear understanding of how a system  functions and how it might be affected by climate  change (CCSP 2008b).  These projects should be designed to withstand the  impacts of climate change, incorporating native  species that will be able to adapt to anticipated future  conditions. The focus should be on maintaining and  enhancing connectivity and preserving ecosystem  functionality and services rather than re-creating  a specific species composition. Representation  and replication can help increase the likelihood of  ecosystem or habitat survival.16 Ensuring resilient  native species and habitats are well-represented and  replicated decreases the possibility of catastrophic  events destroying systems.

There is  often an accompanying decrease in other  functions. Examples of activities associated with these  types of projects include planting and seeding,  which could include plant species adapted to  future climate conditions; waterflow modification;  sediment diversion and/or placement; filling canals;  recontouring topography; dredging and removal  of fill materials; prohibition and removal of shore  protection structures and other barriers that impede  natural processes; water quality improvements; and  invasive species control. Any project designed to restore, establish, or  enhance an ecosystem will require planning, long- term management, monitoring, and, possibly,  land acquisition. In general, of the three project types,  restoration is the most likely to be successful (Interagency  Workgroup on Wetland Restoration 2004). The outcomes  of projects that create new ecosystems or new ecosystem  services are more uncertain, especially when the additional  uncertainties of climate change are factored in. Wetland  creation is usually difficult and typically requires a lot more  planning and effort than restoration projects. Generally, it  is easier to create wetlands from open water than it is to  convert uplands. In either case, one type of ecosystem is  likely to be destroyed in order to establish the new one.  Tradeoffs will need to be made and understood.", "398": "Coral Restoring damaged coral reef ecosystems is an  important part of protecting and preserving ecosystem  health. Reef restoration can help prevent further  degradation and facilitate the natural recovery process.  Future work on developing restoration strategies may  ultimately make reefs more resilient to the impacts of  climate change. To date, most restoration efforts have  been focused on repairing damage caused by human  impacts, such as vessel groundings and anchoring,  and these efforts serve to restore natural function,  structure, and diversity among injured reefs. Managers  have conducted pilot projects on applying restoration  techniques that may be used to respond to climatic  event disturbances, such as coral bleaching, and disease  mortality events. Coral reef restoration largely entails stabilizing  and repairing the damaged framework, recreating  topography, and transplanting corals dislodged,  propagated in nurseries, and/or relocated from other  suitable sources (e.g., corals orphaned as a result of  coastal construction projects).

Properly constructed  and strategically sited artificial reefs can enhance fish  habitat, provide more access to quality fishing grounds,  benefit fishermen and the economies of shore  communities, increase total fish biomass within a given  area, and provide managers with another option for the  conservation and management of fishery resources  (NOAA 2007b). Artificial reefs may also serve as  breakwaters, protecting shorelines from erosion, and  provide recreational opportunities.

There is still considerable debate on how  artificial reefs impact the natural aquatic community  into which they are introduced. Improperly planned,  constructed, or managed reefs may be ineffective, may  cause conflict among competing user groups at the  reef site, may increase the potential to overharvest  targeted species, or may damage natural habitats.

Changes in climate may alter pathways;  influence establishment, spread, and distribution; and  affect the ability of native systems to repel invasion.  Impacts are likely to vary by region as well as species.  Some species, both desirable and invasive, may  thrive under new conditions; others may find them  unsuitable (EPA 2008). Despite the uncertainties,  aquatic invasive species management plays a critical  role in overall ecosystem management and should be  planned and implemented in a manner that is flexible  and considers and monitors for potential changes.  The Non-Indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention  and Control Act of 1990, amended by the National  Invasive Species Act of 1996, calls for states to  develop aquatic invasive species management plans.  By incorporating climate change into these plans, they  could serve as the basis for modifying management  activities (prevention, control, eradication) to meet  changing conditions.

However, it also plays an important  role in preventing damage to the built environment and  the natural systems that protect it. Existing drainage systems may be ill-equipped to  handle the amount of stormwater runoff that will  accompany the more intense rainfall events expected  in the future. Those in low-lying areas will be further  challenged by losses in elevation attributed to rising  sea levels. To accommodate for these changes, coastal  communities may need to modify and enhance the  capacity of their drainage systems and should consider  climate change when implementing and updating  existing stormwater management plans.

With the strategy (goals and actions) in place and  the plan approved, focus on the actions the planning  team has selected. The action plans will guide the  implementation of the individual actions. One of the biggest challenges to the implementation of  climate change adaptation actions is funding. This will  likely require creativity and networking and will be an  ongoing effort. Currently, there is not a lot of funding  directly targeted at climate change adaptation. But, there  are a number of grant opportunities for restoration,  conservation, hazard mitigation, infrastructure (e.g.,  installing new/updating existing), and community and  economic development.  Think about how funds from multiple sources can  be combined as well as how you can work with other  jurisdictions (states and local governments), regional  organizations, and nongovernmental organizations to  pool resources to meet complementary needs. Planning  team members should think about the grants they have  applied for in the past and how these funding vehicles  might also support adaptation activities. Funding may  also be available through nonprofit organizations (e.g.,  environmental advocacy groups), private foundations,  and businesses. In addition to funding, these groups  may also be able to provide in-kind goods and services. It is likely that over the next few years, grant programs  will be created or modified to fund climate change  adaptation actions.

Many tribes have high  internal staff capacity and technical expertise in the fields of natural resource management and scientific analysis.  However, funding for such positions are often from non-climate change-related grants, which limits their capacity to  devote time to climate change planning and analysis for the tribe.45 Other tribes have limited staff capacity for climate  change analyses.46 As such, many tribes have sought expertise from external partners (e.g., universities, federal agencies  and programs, private and non-profit organizations, and intertribal organizations) for training, data, and analysis to  support the tribes climate change adaptation planning efforts.47 It can be important to identify external partners who may have direct management of federal trust responsibilities  over the land and natural resources within the geographic areas of interest and those who could indirectly influence  management within the geographic areas of interest (e.g., federal agencies, state agencies, and regional planning  organizations).  Developing partnerships with external organizations can have benefits beyond the end of a specific climate adaptation  planning project. Collaborations with academic institutions, non-profit or private sector organizations, and federal  agencies can create avenues for lasting technical, communication, grant writing, implementation, or design support. Some  tribes work with neighboring jurisdictions (e.g., city, county, state, federal, private, and other tribes), particularly in the  cases of checkerboard tribes and tribes that have Usual & Accustomed areas that border or are on private or federal lands.

Western Science uses terms such as Traditional Knowledges and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to describe how longstanding generational tribal knowledges are held, transferred, and applied within a tribe, and  when referring to Indigenous Science. These terms attempt to describe what tribes already do without the tribes labeling  it as such. Identifying where and how TKs and TEK are already being applied can serve as a base to build on within the  tribes climate change adaptation planning process.  Identify what TKs are already incorporated in the tribes planning process or management systems, that the tribe may not  describe as TKs, but may be relevant to this western definition. Consider looking for things that may not be called TKs  that the tribe already does and that contain a wealth of knowledge that can be useful for climate adaptation planning:  Identify TKs that are already collected or stored within the tribes cultural committee;  Identify information that may not have been used previously but could now be used (consider adaptations,  patterns, ceremonial adjustments, additional foods, etc.); and  Identify what TKs are being utilized in ways that are not articulated or written (maintenance, sustainability  practices, reciprocity rites, etc). These TKs can be applied throughout the adaptation planning process as appropriate to help identify concerns  (Section 2.2); gather evidence for observed changes (Section 2.3); conduct the vulnerability assessment (Step 3); gather  adaptation actions, set adaptation goals, prioritize actions (Step 4); and define and monitor success of actions (Step 5).", "461": "etermine Whether and How to Collect Additional Traditional Knowledges Consider whether the tribe needs or desires to collect additional TKs and what methods would be used.

Acknowledging that  everything is important, it may be necessary to limit the scope of the adaptation planning process, at least initially, based  on available resources and tribal staff capacity. Over time and with additional resources, the scope may be expanded to  include all the potential concerns related to climate change and develop adaptation actions for every potential concern. Identifying concerns can be done using a variety of approaches with input from the community and the climate change  planning team.

For some tribes, the planning areas are  based around different topic areas or sectors (e.g. fisheries management, transportation, human health, and emergency  management). Other tribes have created planning areas around habitats (e.g., grouping all related species that are  concerns into that habitat) or by climate impact of concern (e.g., rising sea levels, wildfire risk, and extreme heat). There  may be a few concerns that do not neatly fit within a current department or existing program. Those can be considered  cross-cutting issues, requiring collaboration across departments or programs in order to accurately assess vulnerability  and develop effective adaptation actions. Table 6 lists planning areas defined by different tribes. Note: Upon organizing concerns into planning areas, it may become clear that there are gaps in the expertise of the  climate change planning team. This may be an opportunity to add a member with the appropriate expertise to the team  (Section 1.2) or consult with local or regional experts within the tribe or among external partners (Section 1.8).", "466": "Are there current management programs or plans that are already designed to work on or manage the identified  concerns?

There may also be thresholds that, if crossed, will have a  disproportionate impact. For example, warmer water temperatures can negatively affect salmon survival. Water  temperatures exceeding 15.5C [59.9F] increase the rate of disease and mortality among Chinook salmon.6 For each key concern, list climate variables that the concern is sensitive to, making note of particular thresholds.

Actionable information is information at a sufficient  timescale, resolution, and certainty that it can inform decisions.

To evaluate the credibility of individual climate change studies, consider the  following questions from Preparing for Climate Change: 11  Are the authors clearly identified as experts?  Has the study been peer-reviewed?  Does the studys results make sense?  Are the results placed in the context of existing understanding?  Is there supporting evidence for the studys conclusions?

Changes in the extent, magnitude, and frequency of  extreme weather events can have significant effects on the things the tribe cares about. Using existing resources  available for climate projections, it is possible to identify quantitative projections for many of these climate exposures.  Where quantitative projections are not available, exposure can be qualitatively assessed (i.e., identifying direction and  magnitude). See Section 2.4 for more guidance on collecting and summarizing relevant and actionable climate exposure  information. Sensitivitydepends on the nature of the key concern and the climate exposure variable. A particular concern may  be very sensitive to changes in water availability but only slightly sensitive to changes in temperature. For example, the  different tree species pinyon pine and douglas fir, which live near each other in dry coniferous forests, will likely be  exposed to the same increases in temperature and potential drought conditions. However, each species has a different  level of tolerance of drought conditions and thus can be more or less sensitive to those conditions.17 Similarly, due to  physiology, elders and youth are more sensitive to extreme heat events than young adults and adults.18  Adaptive Capacityof a key concern is critical in determining the impacts to climate and extreme weather events.  Identifying key limitations to adaptive capacity can help determine how to design and focus adaptation actions to  reduce those limitations and help the species, asset, or system respond positively to projected changes. For example, with  changing food supplies in a particular habitat, a generalist species that eats a variety of plants will likely have a higher  adaptive capacity than specialist species that relies on only one or two plants for survival. Similarly, a drinking water  supply system that has two water sources (groundwater and surface water) and two sets of pumps is better prepared to  shift between those sources if one source is affected by changing precipitation patterns (has higher adaptive capacity)  than a water supply system dependent on a single water source.  ", "483": "Determine Relative Vulnerability Rankings The tribe can use relative vulnerability rankings to help determine where to focus adaptation planning efforts.  Assigning sensitivity and adaptive capacity scores for the range of climate exposures can be used to calculate the relative  vulnerability of each of the key concerns. One way to do this is by using a relative vulnerability matrix.  High vulnerability key concerns (e.g., orange and red colors in Figure 10) that have higher sensitivities and lower  adaptive capacities. This means that those areas are likely to be affected first and worst by the changing climate  conditions.   Lower vulnerability key concerns (e.g., light and dark green colors in Figure 10) have lower sensitivity and higher  adaptive capacities. This means that those key concerns are not as likely to be affected, wont be affected  immediately, or may be areas of opportunity for the tribe in the future. For example, some species and resources  may actually do better with changing climate conditions, creating potential economic or other opportunities for  the tribe. There are a variety of approaches tribes have used to complete a relative vulnerability assessment process (See Section 3.1 and Section 3.2). A relative vulnerability matrix (Figure 10) such as the one used by the Jamestown SKlallam Tribe, can  summarize information that the tribe can use to focus planning efforts.

Are there alternative options (e.g., redundancy) for the key concern if one aspect of it is damaged?  Are there barriers to the systems ability to accommodate changes in climate (e.g., regulations based on historic  climate conditions; other competing uses of the system; high number of organizations involved in managing the  system; or biologic, geographic, or physical barriers)?

Using a risk assessment, or other approach, to assess the consequences of  changes in climate can help determine which issues will have the greatest impact on the community. Some tribes use  explicit consideration of risk to help determine where to focus their adaptation planning efforts. Others incorporate  consideration of risk into a multi-criteria assessment process. Either way, the goal is to use the information to determine  where to focus the tribes adaptation planning efforts.", "486": "Identify Priority Planning Areas The results of the risk assessment will guide the selection of priority planning areas.

For  example, an action from the US Forest Service Adaptation Resource that says: maintain or restore riparian areas by  promoting a diversity of tree and plant species to increase stream shading, provide a source of woody debris, stabilize the  soil, and provide habitat and connectivity for wildlife6  would ideally be modified to specify which types of trees to plant  and where to plant them.  Gather as many adaptation actions as possible from a variety of sources and then refine those actions, making them  relevant to the tribe. When gathering adaptation actions, consider actions within the categories defined in Table 9. Also,  the tribes staff, climate change planning team, and community members may come up with new possibilities. The  inclusion of TKs within this process has the potential to inform the development of adaptation actions that are better  connected to and support the tribes traditional practices and culture. Create a structure to organize the collected adaptation actions. It may be convenient to organize actions by planning area  and associated goals.

It may mean  creating content for a weekly radio segment or posts in a tribal newsletter to share results or continue the resilience  dialogue in the community. Or, it may mean investing in the development of a video (or series of videos) that shares the  results of the tribes work and can reach an audience that would not be reached through reports or documents.

One challenge is that rarely is it possible to move forward  with all of the priority actions (Section 4.4) at the same time. Consider starting with low or no-cost actions like outreach  and education; or focusing on a key window of opportunity (e.g., a grant-funded activity, an update to a management  plan) as this can be a good opportunity to begin implementing priority actions.  The climate change planning team has already helped identify actions relevant to their tribal departments. The key is to  start with a few small elements and move forward from planning to action. This will demonstrate tangible progress to  the community, tribal leadership, and potential funders, that can help create the momentum for tackling the harder, or  bigger, actions and changes identified in the plan.

Pilot projects have the benefit of not being seen  as permanent and frequently face lower political and financial barriers. If successful, a pilot project (limited in extent or  geographic scope) can rapidly be scaled or rolled out to other areas. Pilot projects demonstrate measurable success and  can:  Help identify obstacles, logistical challenges, and possible unintended consequences in a semi-controlled, small- scale context;  Help determine if goals and timelines are appropriate and that the appropriate tracking, monitoring, and  reporting takes place;  Provide a forum for gathering feedback from tribal members, staff, and leadership that can be used to inform the  full-scale roll out of the action; and  Secure tribal and staff buy-in. A pilot project isnt always necessary. A full-scale launch may be appropriate where similar adaptation actions have  been previously executed under similar conditions (for example, by other tribes, or in areas with similar geography and  topography) with successful results.

These indicators can be focused on specific individual  components of the process (e.g., number of people trained and workshops held) or specific outcomes (e.g., increased  awareness). Process indicators can be used to track progress in implementing action. Outcome indicators can be used  to track progress in reducing environmental risk and enhancing resilience. When developing both types of indicators,  consider the principles for developing good indicators of adaptation success (Table 11). Table 11 Principles for Developing Indicators of Adaptation Success. This table describes three principles and their rationales to  consider when developing indicators of success for adaptation actions. Principle Rationale Focusing on the Purpose Keeping in mind the communitys vision and guiding principles is important for  developing useful and relevant metrics of success. The metrics should:   Align with the tribal communitys vision and goals;  Keep the intended user of the information in mind;   Be assigned to a specific person or department;  Be relevant to any applicable decision-making processes within the tribe; and   Be shared broadly to keep the community engaged. Systems Thinking Everything is connected. Adaptation indicators need to take into account the larger systems  that affect adaptation outcomes. The measures should match the scale of the adaptation  action to the level of integration with other sectors. Creating a group of holistic and  balanced indicators can paint a more realistic picture. For example, consider:  Short- and long-term measures;   Small- and large-scale measures;   Objective and subjective measures; and  Indicators that track primary, secondary, and cascading impacts. Delivering Impact A good indicator will enable verification of the stated adaptation goals. Ensure validity,  where possible make them quantitative, and base them on performance and consequences. Source: Urban Sustainability Directors Network, Developing Urban Climate Adaptation Indicators (Urban Sustainability Directors  Network, 2017). There are multiple criteria for selecting indicators. See Case Studies and Resources for examples. Using measurable  indicators that can be objectively evaluated over time will help assess progress in implementing the adaptation actions.  Indicators can help simplify reporting on progress to tribal members, leadership, and other stakeholders. Consistent  reporting helps to generate additional interest, promote accountability, improve project management, and attract political  and financial support for the resilience building initiative. The tracking timeline will vary depending on the type of  adaptation actions selected. However, this stage is valuable whenever it occurs because it offers the opportunity for  reflection, revision, and improvemen", "503": "Commit to Monitoring Indicators Once the tribe has selected a set of indicators, develop an approach for tracking these indicators and progress in  implementing the adaptation actions overtime.

Developing an efficient, consistent, and reliable approach for collecting and managing the indicators can include:  Identifying which members of the planning team will help with each of the tracking and reporting tasks;  Creating a schedule for collecting the information;  Deciding on the methods used to collect and document this information (if possible integrate information  collection into an existing process or standard operating procedure); and  Establishing how the information will be reported.

Do the criteria for prioritizing key concerns need to be altered based on changes in tribal  priorities?  New Windows of Opportunity: Are there new opportunities for funding or actions that the tribe can take  advantage of to expand the reach and effectiveness of the adaptation actions in the plan?  Enhancing resilience to changing climate conditions is a process and not the result of a single project. The work that the  tribe does in this adaptation planning process outlined in this Tribal Climate Adaptation Guidebook lays the foundation  for all future adaptation planning efforts. This work includes: identifying key climate-related vulnerabilities; convening  the right people to develop effective adaptation actions to reduce those vulnerabilities in a culturally grounded and  appropriate manner; meaningfully engaging the community; incorporating Traditional Knowledges where appropriate;  developing and institutionalizing indicators to measure success; and committing to revisit and update data, products,  materials, and plans over time. A solid adaptation planning foundation can support the tribe long after the funding for  any single adaptation effort runs out. Flexibility and a willingness to update the adaptation actions over time will ensure  that the tribe and the critical natural and cultural resources that are integral to the economic, cultural, and spiritual fabric  of the community continue to thrive for the next seven generations.", "511": "Local government has an important role  to play in efforts to reduce greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions and limit the impacts  of climate change.

This guide provides the climate vulnerability assessment  tools to evaluate climate risk and adaptive capacity, specific indicators to include in  vulnerability assessment, and the following definition of vulnerable communities: Climate vulnerability describes the degree to which natural, built, and  human systems are at risk of exposure to climate change impacts. Vulnerable  communities experience heightened risk and increased sensitivity to climate  change and have less capacity and fewer resources to cope with, adapt to,  or recover from climate impacts. These disproportionate effects are caused by  physical (built and environmental), social, political, and/or economic factor(s),  which are exacerbated by climate impacts. These factors include, but are not  limited to, race, class, sexual orientation and identification, national origin, and  income inequality.25", "545": "The Fourth Climate Change Assessment and related research also affirm that several  communities already feel the cumulative burden of climate change, environmental  pollution, and historical socioeconomic disparities.26 It is important to identify and  acknowledge these communities because there is an opportunity in climate  adaptation planning to address issues holistically. Communities that have long  experiences with systemic exclusion and resource deprivation have developed assets,  coping skills, and knowledge that can benefit overall climate resilience planning.  Robust community engagement in plan development, as recommended throughout  the APG, can bring these communities wisdom into local resilience efforts. ", "546": "Second, through all phases of adaptation planning, it is helpful to think of equity as  multidimensional and having three objectives: 1) procedural, 2) distributional, and  3) structural (see Table 3).27 State agencies and tribal governments have additional  resources for equity and inclusion in adaptation planning, including the California  Department of Public Healths Climate Change and Health Equity Program, the  California Environmental Protection Agencys Office of Environmental Justice, the  California Office of Emergency Services Access and Functional Needs Section, and  the Pala Band of Mission Indian Tribe Environmental Departments climate adaptation  resources and templates.

Scoping the planning process includes determining how to publish, adopt, and  implement the results. Adaptation work typically becomes part of one of three main  categories of planning mechanisms: 1) comprehensive plans, 2) focused plans, and 3)  implementation programs (see Figure 6).  The comprehensive plans establish a framework and overarching guidelines for  adaptation planning and implementation.  The focused plans set more-specific objectives based on the framework and  guidelines.

Communities are not limited to integrating  adaptation planning work into these  three mechanisms, and the California  Government Code  65302(g)(4) allows  for any plan or document containing  this information to meet the states requirements. However, in practice, the general  plan, climate action or adaptation plan, or local hazard mitigation plan are the most  commonly used options to ensure that climate adaptation is addressed in a holistic  and fully integrated way. The Introduction of this guide provides more information  about these local planning efforts.", "560": "Equity. A resilient community is one in which all members of a community are  able to effectively prepare for and recover from acute and chronic climate  impacts. Ideally, all community members are equally resilient regardless of  income, health, identity, education, and other socioeconomic factors. Removing  all disparities is an aspirational goal and may be beyond what an individual  community can achieve, but a resilient community should strive for confidence  that all members of the community are prepared for and able to recover from  climate change impacts.", "561": "Holistic approach. Ensuring the health and safety of community members  is critical to building resiliency, but it is not the only factor. Total community  well-being depends on many different systemsbuilt, natural, and sociopolitical.  For example, if a wildfire damages a forest, the number of tourists may drop,  which may result in economic hardship for communities with tourist-based  economies and affect the well-being and adaptive capacity of people who own  and work at such businesses. A resilient population is not possible if the systems  that people depend on are not themselves resilient. Additionally, a regional  approach to climate adaptation can help ensure an efficient and effective  process that gets the greatest possible benefit from limited resources.", "562": " Future needs. Communities are constantly changing. As buildings are  constructed and torn down, people move in and out, businesses open and  close, and other systems in a community change, the resiliency needs of the  community change as well. For example, many older Americans want to stay  in their homes or communities rather than moving to retirement homes or June 2020 39 California Adaptation Planning Guide assisted care facilities, which creates a different set of resiliency needs. When  thinking about what resiliency means for the community, consider it from the  perspective of community members of all ages and future assets, not only  current ones. Additionally, some communities adopt ambitious housing plans  to help bridge severe gaps between community needs for affordable housing  options and current supply. These housing plans substantially influence the  resilience of precariously housed low-income households and individuals currently  experiencing homelessness due to lack of housing supply", "563": "COMMUNITY VISION FOR ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE A vision statement captures what  community members most value about  their community and what they want their  community to become. When drafting  a vision statement, it is helpful to think  about how the community will be similar  or different in the future (e.g., in 10, 20, 30,  or 50 years or more)how it will function,  what it will be known for, who will be  served by the community and its services,  what it will look like, what resources will be  needed, and more. Preparation of a vision statement should  be as inclusive as possible. Visioning is  often the first activity of a community  engagement process. The process can  include a variety of activities to engage  stakeholders in visioning. Ultimately, the  ideas and recommendations should be  compiled into a single draft vision that is  vetted through the adaptation planning  process. Goals should be statements of the desired  outcomes from the adaptation planning  process based on the vision of a resilient  community. A vision statement and goals  should reflect the needs, priorities, and  values of the community and of the  stakeholders involved in the planning  effort. Consider visions and goals that  help connect local adaptation planning  to State efforts, such as the ICARP vision and principles. Establishing goals early creates  a common foundation for the future work of everyone involved. Participants can refer  back to these goals throughout the planning process to help ensure that they are on the  right track. Later in the process, after preparing the vulnerability assessment, participants  prepare more-specific goals as a framework for the adaptation policies. Phase 3 of the  APG provides additional guidance for drafting goals.", "564": "HAT IS THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA? The participating jurisdictions usually  define the geographic area of the plan  or project. For example, a city conducting  adaptation planning efforts will focus on  building resiliency within its city limits or  sphere of influence. Similarly, a countys  efforts usually support adaptation  in unincorporated areas within its  boundaries. Regional governments may  also conduct adaptation work for all  jurisdictions in their area, and multiple  jurisdictions may collaborate on regional  adaptation work, creating a geographic  area that spans multiple jurisdictions.  However, sometimes the planning  area is not as clear cut as political  boundaries. Adaptation planning for  a natural resource or ecosystema  watershed, for examplemay need  to cover a broad area that does not  follow political boundaries. Even if the  planning effort is limited to a specific  area with defined boundaries (such  as a state park), natural areas outside  of these boundaries may need to be  included to the extent possible to help  ensure resiliency. Specific areas within a  community, such as neighborhoods or  defined frontline communities, may also be the focus of an adaptation planning effort.  Frontline communities are populations that experience the impacts of issues such  as environmental pollution, climate change, and the economic crisis first and most  severely. They are most often communities of color and/or low-income.4", "565": "WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS? Like all other planning efforts, adaptation planning requires time and effort. Local  government agency staff and other stakeholders will need to commit their time,  technical and financial resources, and the available knowledge of everyone involved  to ensure a successful process.  The time frame for the adaptation planning process may be determined by a grant,  budget cycle, direction from elected officials, community priorities, or other factors.  The breakdown of the adaptation planning process in Table 4 shows the phases and  steps in this guide and estimates the timing of each step. Steps may take more or  less time depending on capacity, funding, scope details, and other characteristics.  Following all phases could take 12 to 24 months, depending on the level of detail and  resources committed to each phase. It is also possible to work on more than one step  at the same time. Considerations that can affect the time frame of the process are:   Availability of local agency staff and other stakeholders who will lead and/or  participate in the planning process.  Need for external support from consultants, community partners, or other external  partners to complete the process.  Data availability from internal and external providers and whether any new  technical studies are needed.  Commitment to community and stakeholder engagement (beyond those who  are leading the process), including types and timing of events and opportunities.  As discussed in Step 1.4, providing opportunities for stakeholder engagement can  be critical to ensuring the success of an adaptation planning project.   Requirements for review and participation by external agencies. Some planning  mechanisms, such as general plan safety elements or local hazard mitigation  plans, require review by external agencies that can take many months", "566": "WHAT IS THE BUDGET FOR THE PLANNING PROCESS? The budget should consider the needs of each phase, inclusive of the financial  resources to support stakeholder engagement. Budgets should include labor costs to  complete the work in addition to other costs, including equipment, meeting supplies,  materials, production, transportation, training, facility rental, and food for meetings.

The project team should have a primary point  of contact or team leader who coordinates the process and team meetings. The  team leader should be empowered to make recommendations and/or have direct  access to decision-makers. If resources allow, the project team can be supported by  an advisory group with a larger membership to include representatives of partner  agencies and community organizations that provide subject matter expertise and  credibility to the process.

The easiest  way to start is to exclude climate change effects that are not expected in the defined  planning area. For example, a community in the high desert will probably not need to  include coastal hazards. With such a diverse environment throughout California, urban  and rural communities respectively face their own unique set of challenges due to  climate change. However, because climate change does not respect geographic boundaries,  hazards outside of a defined planning area may still be harmful to that planning June 2020 57 California Adaptation Planning Guide area. For instance, a wildfire can significantly impair regional air quality, block major  transportation routes, depress tourism, create refugees, and cause many other  impacts that extend beyond the burned area. Communities in the region may be  affected even if they have no wildfire-prone areas in their boundaries. It may be worth  including hazards that could affect areas of major regional employment or other large  economic drivers (such as state or national parks and forests), disrupt key infrastructure  (such as roads, rails, and power lines), or affect important resources that a community  relies on (such as snowpack that can affect water availability). If the adaptation planning effort is for a special district, such as a water provider  or park district, the number of climate changerelated effects may be smaller,  depending on the affected buildings, infrastructure, or resources. For example, ocean  acidification is likely not a hazard of concern for school districts, even those in coastal  communities.", "581": "WHAT ARE THE POPULATIONS AND ASSETS IN THE COMMUNITY? Climate change does not have the same effects in all parts of a community. Some  people and physical assets will be affected much more severely than others, and  adaptation planning efforts need to evaluate the full range of potential effects.  Communities should select the specific populations and assets to assess in order to  clearly understand how susceptible different people, places, and systems of the  community are to climate changerelated hazards and other effects. This allows 60 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate the community to develop adaptation  policies that respond to specific climate  vulnerabilities and build resiliency for the  most susceptible people and assets in the  community. Similar to identifying climate  change effects themselves, the goal here  is to compile a preliminary list of potential  populations and assets to help support  project scoping and the other steps of  this phase. The detailed vulnerability  assessment, including asset mapping, is  completed in Phase 2. What Is a Physical Asset? An asset is any feature of a  community that is not a person or  group of people. Assets include  the natural environment as well  as the built environment, such  as buildings and infrastructure  systems. Populations and assets are usually organized into a handful of categories or  sectors. For consistency with Safeguarding California and the California Adaptation  Clearinghouse, the APG organizes by 11 sectors:   Agriculture  Biodiversity and Habitat  Emergency Services  Energy  Forestry  Land Use and Community Development  Ocean and Coast Resources  Parks and Recreation   Public Health  Transportation  WaterJune 2020 61 California Adaptation Planning Guide Communities are free to use an organizing approach that better meets local needs.  For example, Placer County used the following categories in its adaptation planning  efforts for identifying populations and assets:7  Populations  Infrastructure  Buildings and Facilities  Economic Assets   Ecosystems  Services Regardless of how they are organized, virtually all people and assets in a community  will be affected by climate change in some way. However, it is not usually feasible to  assess the vulnerability of every population group or every asset in the community.  At the same time, adaptation planners should ensure that their assessment does  not exclude populations and assets that face greater harm or are critical to the  communitys well-being. When deciding which populations and assets to include,  consider these questions:  Is the population or asset likely to face substantive harm from climate-related  effects?  Is the population or asset likely susceptible to climate-related effects in a unique  way, different from most other populations or assets in the community?  If the population or asset is substantially harmed, are there significant  negative consequences to the community? Consider both direct and indirect  consequences and remember that consequences may not be evident until well  after the harm occurs.  Is the population or asset important to the community or other stakeholders?  Is the population or asset necessary to achieve overarching resiliency goals? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, the population or asset in question  should likely be included", "582": "People To help decide which groups of people to evaluate for climate-related susceptibility,  focus on populations who are likely to face the most harm from climate change. These  persons are sometimes said to be socially vulnerable or to have social vulnerability.  This does not mean that they lack resilient qualities. A person may be vulnerable to  climate-related consequences but have very strong social networks and community  involvement, which improve individual resiliency. It also does not mean that they are 62 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate responsible for their vulnerability or that they could have made different choices  that would have improved their resiliency. Many socially vulnerable people have  historically faced, and continue to face, systemic social, economic, and political  marginalization and injustice. By identifying groups that are socially vulnerable,  communities acknowledge the systemic discrimination that many such persons  have faced and seek to correct these wrongs and build resiliency in a manner that is  equitable and just. There are many reasons why some groups of people are more susceptible to climate- related hazardslimited access to financial resources, health challenges or disabilities  (physical, cognitive, behavioral, and all other forms), living or working conditions that  result in greater exposure to hazard events, physical or social isolation, historical and  current marginalization or deprivation of resources, and reduced agency or ability to  make decisions. These are all factors that can lead to a greater potential for harm,  and many people fall into more than one category. When selecting populations for an adaptation planning effort, consider the underlying  factors that contribute to a group being potentially susceptible. It may help to  combine populations that have similar root issues, are likely to face similar levels  of vulnerability and may benefit from similar adaptation solutions. For example, it  might make more sense for a community to assess low-income households (<80  percent of area median income), very low-income households (<50 percent), and  extremely low-income households (<30 percent) in one category. Other communities  might benefit from evaluating these three groups separately. A group of potentially  susceptible people should not be excluded simply because it represents a small  percentage of the total population. However, it may not be possible to accurately  assess the vulnerability of a very small number of people. If there are extremely  small groups who should be included in the adaptation planning efforts, consider  combining them with another group, as appropriate. Examples of potential populations to include are:8  Chronically ill persons, including those with compromised immune systems  Foster children  Incarcerated persons  Linguistically isolated persons  Low-income persons  Persons experiencing homelessness  Persons in designated disadvantaged communities  Persons in overcrowded households  Persons with disabilitiesJune 2020 63 California Adaptation Planning Guide  Persons without access to lifelines  Persons working outdoors, including farmworkers  Persons working in industries that may be subject to transition or elimination as a  result of climate change   Renters  Senior citizens, especially those living alone  Single female heads of households  Students  Tribal communities  Undocumented persons  Visitors and seasonal residents  Young children For more guidance on selecting populations for climate adaptation planning, and to  foster equity in implementation, see the Vulnerable Populations and Equity Checklist  appendices of Planning and Investing for a Resilient California and the ICARP guide,  Defining Vulnerable Communities in the Context of Climate Adaptation.", "583": "Built Assets There are many reasons to include built assets (buildings, infrastructure systems, developed  land uses, important economic drivers, etc.) in an adaptation planning effort. Some  built assets are used daily by a large percentage of the population and their damage  or loss would significantly disrupt community members. Some built assets provide  important services, such as delivering water or electricity. Some employ many people  in the community or attract large numbers of visitors, and the community would face  economic hardship if the asset had to limit its operations or close. Other built assets, such  as local landmarks or historically/culturally significant locations, may not provide tangible  benefits but are a source of community pride. Also, consider built assets not only for  their day-to-day performance, but for their value during or after a major emergency.  For example, people may not think of their local community hall or recreation center as  a critical asset, but during emergency events, these buildings can be assembly points,  shelters, and bases of operations for response and recovery operations.  When developing the individual categories of built assets, consider whether similar  assets should be grouped together or evaluated separately. It may make sense  to evaluate separately very important assets or those whose loss would be highly  disruptive. For example, communities can generally group roadways into one  category, but it may make sense to evaluate each major roadway or highway  individually. If a handful of similar built assets face different potential harms (for 64 Phase 1: Define, Explore, and Initiate example, multiple hospitals or wastewater treatment plants in different parts of the  community that are exposed to different climate-related hazards), it might also be  helpful to evaluate these separately. Consider whether it is helpful to evaluate the service a built asset provides separately  from the buildings or infrastructure that provide the service. Although they seem  related, the two could experience different degrees of vulnerability to natural hazards  and require different adaptation solutions. For example, a drought can significantly  affect water deliveries in the community, even if it causes no physical damage to the  water infrastructure. A hospital might survive a severe storm event with no damage or  loss of capacity, but emergency medical response service can be harmed by blocked  or damaged roadways. Examples of potential built asset categories are:  Airports  Bridges and tunnels  Communication systems and service  Community facilities (recreation centers, libraries, senior centers, etc.)  Power lines, natural gas pipes, water lines, and related services  Flood control infrastructure  Goods movement  Government offices and government continuity  Grocery stores  Major employers and economic sectors  Major roads and highways, especially evacuation routes  Medical facilities  Parks  Power plants  Public safety service  Rail lines  Schools, including colleges and universities  Transit stops", "584": "Natural and Managed Resource Assets These assets include natural ecosystems as well as assets that seem natural but are  closely controlled by humans, such as agricultural lands and managed timberlands.  They can include the land or water itself, the plant and animal communities that June 2020 65 California Adaptation Planning Guide live there, and less tangible benefits such as healthy biodiversity. Paleontological or  geological resources could also be included in this category, including those that are  extracted for economic benefits. There are many reasons to include natural and managed resource assets. First and  foremost, many of these assets are defining characteristics of the community and  the region and are considered invaluable to the people who live there. In a state  with such diverse and prized natural systems, natural and managed resource assets  can have tremendous symbolic value and be an enormous source of pride. In many  communities, these assets directly or indirectly employ large numbers of people  in recreation, tourist-serving activities, agriculture and food processing, and other  economic sectors. Natural and managed resource assets can also provide critical  ecosystem services, such as dunes and wetlands that help buffer coastal communities  from storm surges and high tides. Examples of potential natural and managed resource assets are:  Beaches  Chaparral  Endangered, threatened, and sensitive species  Farms, orchards, and vineyards  Forests  Greenbelts  Hiking and biking trails  Historic and cultural resource areas  Keystone species  Lakes and rivers  Livestock  Meadows and grasslands  Metal, stone, petroleum, and other extracted resources  Pastures  Scenic views or ridgelines  State and national parks, forests, wilderness areas, and other protected locations  Timber resources  Wetlands  Wildlife corridors", "585": "The APG recommends integrating  community outreach and engagement  into all phases of the adaptation planning  process. This will build trust between the  core planning team and community  stakeholders and develop a plan that  has collective support. Outreach and  engagement should be considered  carefully and budgeted appropriately.  The approach should include  stakeholders within the organization or  agency leading the adaptation planning  process, and those external to the  organization or agency.", "586": "Additionally, it is helpful if all members of the core planning team are trained in  outreach before engaging stakeholders. Topics such as cultural humility, racism, and  systems of injustice are issues that some may not be used to addressing in relation  to climate risk, but it is critical to understand those power dynamics when working  with vulnerable populations. For example, Figure 7 shows how populations deal with  underlying structural root causes, social factors, and biological factors that could  contribute to increased sensitivity to climate change. Understanding these causes  and factors before the outreach process helps create avenues of communication and  builds trust between the project team and the community", "587": "After assembling the core planning team, it is essential to enlist residents, businesses,  students, and other community groups because they have knowledge, information,  and ideas that local governments may not know or anticipate.

Determine culturally specific outreach needs and strategies.  Link planning and outreach messages to community values and needs.  Develop outreach goals for each stakeholder group and the broader community.  Establish how to engage individuals and groups best and specify objectives and  roles.  Define the specific methods to most effectively engage each group: in a  meeting, via digital communications, one-on-one, or through partners or other  groups.  Detail how these activities will integrate with other planning efforts.  Determine need, objectives, and composition for an advisory group.  Determine the focus and purpose of each event, meeting, and input opportunity.

Protecting a healthy  local economy is a critical part of  maintaining a communitys long-term  resilience, and many businesses recognize  the threat that climate change may pose  to their activities and financial health.  Businesses also can provide increased  investments and other resources that may  not always be available to individual  communities. This creates opportunities  for businesses and local governments to  join or create public-private partnership  to address resilience issues. Opportunities  for public-private partnerships include  creating an economic working group  or advisory body, establishing training  and capacity-building opportunities  such as resilience or continuity planning  workshops, and setting adaptation  standards for permitting new private  developments. Communities can  join with local businesses as well as  larger companies that may be able  to meaningfully contribute to local  efforts. Local governments should  consider how best to use public-private  partnerships to support comprehensive  community adaptation efforts, because  businesses may be able to bolster resilience for other stakeholders and members of  the community. Local governments can consider how best to weigh the needs of  businesses along with the requirements of other community members.", "592": "STAKEHOLDER MAPPING  The engagement process should be inclusive and multidisciplinary. It should  include people at varying levels of authority, including those empowered to  make recommendations and decisions and representatives of governmental and  nongovernmental organizations. Stakeholder identification and mapping supports an  equitable outreach and engagement approach. Stakeholder mapping is the process  of visualizing relationships and prioritizing engagement efforts through understanding  perspectives and interests in the community. The Regional Resilience Toolkit includes  template worksheets to do this.16 For each stakeholder, the project team should  decide who should be involved; what their role will be in the process and the plan  implementation; and how, when, and how often they should be engaged (see  Figure 8). Furthermore, stakeholder mapping should list vulnerable populations to assess how  they will be involved. As mentioned in Step 1.3, vulnerable populations can include  chronically ill persons, foster children, incarcerated persons, linguistically isolated  persons, low-income persons, persons experiencing homelessness, persons in  designated disadvantaged communities, persons in overcrowded households, persons  with disabilities, persons without access to lifelines, renters, senior citizens, single female  heads of households, students, tribal communities, undocumented persons, visitors  and seasonal residents, and young children", "593": "CREATING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES Keeping stakeholder mapping in mind is important for each outreach and  engagement activity. Moreover, the core planning team should determine what they  are trying to achieve and help manage what the public should expect.

See Table 7  for the International Association of Public Participation (IAP2) Spectrum.17, 18 The IAP2 spectrum is a theoretical model for varying levels of participation and  engagement and is not a specific recommendation for any one set of activities or  goals. Local agencies and communities need to decide what level of engagement is  appropriate to facilitate community participation in decision-making.  Core activities and characteristics necessary to building a diligent and robust public  engagement process include:  Providing educational opportunities.  Soliciting community input.  Maintaining a direct method of communication with the community specifically  for the climate adaptation planning effort.

GHG emissions scenarios reflect different projections  for how global emissions and atmospheric GHG concentrations may change over  time. The latest scenarios are representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and  Cal-Adapt provides projections for a low emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) and a high  emissions scenario (RCP 8.5). The Governors Office of Planning and Research (OPR)  recommends that agencies use RCP 8.5 for analyses considering impacts through  2050 because there are minimal differences between emissions scenarios during  the first half of the century.1  For analyses considering impacts beyond 2050, OPR  recommends selecting warming scenarios on a case-by-case basis. For a more  conservative approach to a given community element, consider using only RCP 8.5.  For a less conservative approach, use both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Which approach  will be most useful in selecting emissions scenarios depends on a given community  elements risk and criticality. ", "603": "Selecting climate models. For each GHG emissions scenario, retrieve projections from  a range of global climate models (GCMs), which vary based on the different modeling  assumptions. The most current GCMs come from the Coupled Model Intercomparison  Project, version 5 (CMIP-5), developed to support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change. Though using all 32 CMIP 5 GCMs is ideal for a comprehensive assessment,  there are subsets of 10 and 4 GCMs that closely simulate Californias climate and can  be used in studies that cannot accommodate all 32 models.2, 3  Cal-Adapts default  settings provide outputs for these subsets of 10 and 4 models, depending on the hazard.4 Considering a range of climate model outputsin addition to an ensemble average can be helpful in getting a fuller picture of potential future conditions. State guidance,  including from the Safeguarding California Plan and the California Ocean Protection  Council, recommends evaluating a range of future climate scenarios appropriate for  planning decisions and respective risk aversion level. For example, high-end scenarios  (e.g., H++ scenario for sea-level rise) are recommended for use with high-stakes decisions  where underaccounting for projected changes could lead to significant financial or  environmental impacts or public health and safety consequences. It is also important to retrieve climate projections for the appropriate time frame. After  selecting the historical baseline and future time horizon of interest, pull climate data  for a multi-decade period (usually 20 or 30 years) centered on the year of interest.

For instance, in the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation  Authoritys Metro Climate Action and Adaptation Plan 2019, Metro scored the  relevant climate change effects to identify the greatest vulnerabilities and prioritize  transportation assets for adaptation actions. To score potential impact and adaptive capacity, use the rubric in Table 10 as a  guide, but adjust the scoring system to the circumstances. For example, if using three  scoring levels is not enough, the system can expand to four, five, or more levels.  Criteria can be customized to reflect the goals specific to the community, such as  quantifiable metrics related to safety, costs, or other factors. Different inputs can help  with the scoring process, depending on the project teams capacity and stakeholder  engagement.

Several problem statements  or groups may lead to a single adaptation goal. The APG uses 11 sectors (see Figure 4)  to support organization of example strategies, which are defined in Appendix A.  Communities can use the same sectors or follow an organizational approach that best  fits their implementation needs. When drafting goals, it is important to start with a review of existing goals in the  communitys planning documentse.g., general plan and LHMPand state plans  such as Safeguarding California and the State Hazard Mitigation Plan. This review  will help the project team determine if existing community goals support the vision,  respond to the vulnerability assessment and will support integration and alignment of  adaptation and resilience goals. Goals that respond to the vulnerability assessment, such as those that seek to increase  adaptive capacity, protect assets, and reduce impacts from hazards and other  climate change effects, help other stakeholders see how resilience fits with existing  community priorities. Goals should be clear and accessible to all stakeholders, and  they should reduce or avoid long-term vulnerabilities. The goals will be supported by  strategies developed in Step 3.3.  The General Plan Guidelines (2017) define a goal as a general direction-setter. It is  an ideal future end related to the public health, safety, or general welfare. A goal is a  general expression of community values and may be abstract in nature. It may not be  quantifiable or time dependent.4 The FEMA Local Mitigation Handbook describes goals as general guidelines that  explain what the community wants to achieve with the plan. They are usually broad, June 2020 111 California Adaptation Planning Guide policy-type statements that are long term, and they represent visions for reducing or  avoiding losses from the identified hazards.5 Goals should be designed with consideration to how progress can be tracked or  monitored. Some communities may prepare one or more objective statement for  each goal. These objective statements are meant to be specifically measurable  in some way that shows progress toward the goal. For example, a goal to reduce  community vulnerability to wildfires might have objectives for the percentage of  homes that meet defensible space best practices.

Development of June 2020 137 California Adaptation Planning Guide adaptation strategies likely included identification of a potential lead department  and/or partners tasked to implement a strategy, a time frame for implementation, and  potential cost estimates. When starting Phase 4 and implementation, the first step is to  prepare an implementation program and to confirm the implementation mechanism  and responsible department of entity needed for each adaptation strategy. Some  strategies will be implemented upon adoption of the plan prepared as a result of the  adaptation planning process, while others will need to be further developed and/or  be integrated into other plans or programs. All adaptation strategies have temporal components that include time to implementation,  timing of necessary action, and duration of effectiveness. These elements of time must be  considered for all strategies and when devising the method of measure delivery. For implementation strategies that will be further developed or implemented, the  team should identify the planning document or other mechanism best suited to drive  strategy implementation, as well as any documents that should be amended to ensure  consistency. The answers to two questions can help clarify the choice of mechanism: 1. Which mechanism most closely overlaps the intent and topic area of a strategy? 2. Which mechanism is next slated for update or revision?", "632": "Regardless of how they are implemented, adaptation strategies tend to be in more than  one plan, such as the general plan, local hazard mitigation plan (LHMP), climate action or  sustainability plan, integrated regional water management plan, and capital investment  plan. Other possible mechanisms for adaptation strategies are discussed in Phase 1.  General plans. In 2017, OPR released updated General Plan Guidelines. These  guidelines are a resource for understanding where climate adaptation strategies  are best integrated into a general plan. Climate adaptation influences content  in all chapters of a general plan; however, the element that often holds the most  adaptation content is the safety or comparable element. Other elements of the  general plan, including optional elements such as an equitable and resilient  communities element, may also have adaptation content.1   The safety element is the primary location for addressing climate-exacerbated  hazards and climate change impacts. This includes identifying community  vulnerabilities associated with climate change (see the vulnerability assessment  described in Phase 2) and developing strategies to address these vulnerabilities  (Phase 3). The safety element should include a vulnerability assessment or a  reference to where it is in another document. This element in particular must  be consistent with the LHMP if the community has one. It also needs to be  consistent with other elements of the general plan, such as land use, circulation,  housing, conservation, air quality, and environmental justice.138 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust   The land use element includes  the planned future pattern of all  community land uses and can  include policy language that  reduces the vulnerability of existing  and new development.   A circulation element can include  policies ensuring appropriate  ingress and egress for all  neighborhoods and that major  circulation corridors are not  endangered by climate impacts  and addressing other mobility- related vulnerabilities.   Housing element policies ensure  that all residential land use by  type, location, and building  standards are resilient to heat,  poor air quality, and all other  potential climate impacts. These  policies can also address the  availability of housing and the  vulnerabilities of persons who are  susceptible to climate change due  to their living situation. The California Department of Housing and Community  Development (HCD) has an abundance of technical assistance available to  local governments.   The conservation and open space elements include strategies to protect  vulnerable ecosystems (habitat, sensitive and endangered species, other  flora and fauna). They may also include policies to reduce vulnerabilities from  hazards in natural areas (e.g., fire).   The air quality element can address vulnerabilities from climate-influenced  pollutants. For example, this optional element could address vulnerabilities  from increased ozone due to warmer temperatures, and issues from increased  particulate matter associated with drought or fire.   The environmental justice element or content can specifically acknowledge  that some subpopulations in a community are disproportionately vulnerable to  climate impacts, particularly with respect to health outcomes. This element or  content area relates to many other elements in the general plan. City of Hermosa Beach  General Plan and  Climate Change The City of Hermosa Beach  General Plan, adopted in 2017,  has a section in the safety  element focused on climate  change impacts and adaptation.  This section addresses sea level  rise, extreme heat, and other  potential impacts, such as public  health, precipitation, water,  biological resources, agriculture,  marine resources, and energy. The  plan includes potential impacts  of projected climate change  and strategies to ensure the city is  prepared for them. 2June 2020 139 California Adaptation Planning Guide  Local hazard mitigation plans. LHMPs  include both long-term and short-term  hazard mitigation planning. They can  include discussion of emergency  preparation and response, such as  notification systems and available  resources for emergency response  activities. These plans also should  ensure that communities are  prepared for escalating climate  vulnerabilities. The LHMP should be  consistent with a communitys general  plan safety element.  Climate action plans/sustainability  plans. Climate action plans (CAPs)  or sustainability plans are broad  strategic plans to address climate  change or sustainability. They do  not have a standard structure or  form, unlike other mechanisms such  as general plans. Climate change  adaptation is often a component,  although some may focus only on  greenhouse gas reductions. They  may include or refer to a vulnerability  assessment (Phase 2). Some of their  strategies often overlap with the  general plan, LHMP, and other plans  such as a bike and pedestrian plan.  Many CAPs and related documents  discuss implementation issues,  including assigning responsible  entities, funding, and indicators for  monitoring.", "633": "Integrated regional water management plans. Integrated regional water  management (IRWM) plans address water concerns at a regional level. SB 1672 (2002)  requires IRWM plans that address water supply and quality, flood protection, and other  matters. The California Department of Water Resources IRWM planning guidelines  require the inclusion of climate change considerations in IRWM planning analyses.  In an effort to assist practitioners, the Department of Water Resources developed a  listing of climate change documents relevant to IRWM planning. The regional-level  assessment, oversight, and strategies can deliver higher value investments and balance  priorities among multiple jurisdictions. This is particularly important in settings such as  the California Delta Ecosystem or the Salton Sea, where watershed issues fall under the  authority of several local, regional, and state agencies.  Capital improvement planning. A local governments capital improvement plan  is an annual or biennial plan for financing community projects and is typically  what funds community assets or infrastructure, such as bridges, water treatment  facilities, or community centers and smaller projects such as new bike lanes or  sidewalks. These projects may be directly vulnerable to climate hazards, may  serve as shelters or gathering places or may provide evacuation routes during  emergency situations. Having local community facilities and infrastructure that  are climate resilient bolsters local adaptive capacity. In addition, integrating  adaptation into the planning and design efforts for public projects nearly always  saves a community money through avoided losses, even if the up-front costs of a  new location or additional structural measures are slightly higher.5 Climate-resilient  features may also reduce regular maintenance and operation costs of some  facilities (such as rooftop solar panels).  ", "634": "Adaptation strategies, regardless of the plan or program that contains them, need  to be implemented to achieve their intended outcome.

This process builds on the prioritization  of adaptation needs and strategies in previous phases, and outreach and funding  are covered in subsequent sections. The way to implement adaptation actions will  vary by location and jurisdictional context. Things to consider when developing the  implementation approach are:6, 7  Build on existing processes. Building on actions already proven effective in a  community is a great place to start. Ideally, pursuit of this concept began in  Phase 3, but further implementation includes integrating strategies into programs  already in place from another plan, such as the general plan or LHMP. Bolstering  or altering existing programs builds on internal strengths. Staff may already be June 2020 141 California Adaptation Planning Guide familiar with a particular type of  policy or program, cutting down  on training, the startup time, and  associated costs.  Assess cost-effectiveness. The  project team should evaluate each  implementation method for cost,  down to the department and staffing  requirements. This process also begins  in earlier phases, such as Phase 3, but  has a role here. In situations where  multiple implementation options can  achieve the same adaptation goal,  cost/benefit assessment is a way to  compare measures to determine  the most cost-effective option or a  sequence of measures that starts  with the most fiscally feasible but  potentially lower adaptation benefit  in the short term. At its simplest, such  an assessment looks at whether  or not an action can be funded  on an ongoing basis through the  general fund. This case can be  bolstered in when implementation  yields future cost savings, offsetting  the implementation cost. Strategies  such as altering the building code  for cooler (lighter color) roofs is an  example that does not impose  high costs directly on the local  government. Other actions may be  funded with establishment of a new  fee system. Larger, structural projects  are often funded through bonds.  The measures that are more difficult  to implement rely most on external  funding or financing. In many cases,  this is the most feasible option, but  also the most tenuous.  City of Chula Vista Cost  Effective Measures  Chula Vista, through use of the  Climate Change Working Group  (CCWG), adopted adaptation  actions in 2011. The CCWG was  made up of residents, businesses,  and community representatives.  In collaboration with city staff, this  group brainstormed a lengthy list  of potential measures, which it  ultimately trimmed to 11 based on  factors such as local jurisdictional  authority and cost considerations.  These considerations resulted  in nearly all of the 11 actions  being implemented. One such  success was cool roofs. The  CCWG recommended and city  staff implemented a new cool  roof ordinance. The measure  was estimated to cost less than  $30,000, an amount deemed  feasible for the city budget.8, 9142 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust  Leverage community and  private sector alliances. Aligning  strategies with local community  groups and private sector entities  is a good way to ensure ongoing  effectiveness. It also is a way to  limit cost burden by delegating  aspects of implementation to an  external entity. This can be formally  established with an MOU or a similar  formal partnership agreement. The  following section describes outreach  specifically, a critical part of ensuring  that adaptation benefits are shared  in all parts of a community and that  the actions bolster social equity.  Establish partnerships regionally. Geographic boundaries should  not constrain adaptive actions,  and some adaptive actions require  regional collaboration. Regional  compacts or less formal partnerships  with regional entities can assist  communities with technical  assistance and potential funding.  Regional partnerships also are a  good way to engage in peer-to-peer  learning with communities that share  similar challenges. The Alliance of  Regional Collaboratives for Climate  Adaptation provides the context  for many parts of the state to foster  learning, allow for collaborative  pursuit of funding opportunities, and  develop private sector adaptation  support. 10", "635": "IMPLEMENTATION OUTREACH When the adaptation planning is complete and the plan is approved, the transition  to implementation can be celebrated with a fun, public event. Such an event is an  opportunity to honor stakeholders and their role in the process and is the next step  of implementation. The event should be planned with those already engaged in the  process, but this is also an opportunity to identify stakeholders that have not been  involved and could be important voices and partners during implementation. This  includes communities most likely impacted by one or more points of vulnerability or  affected by the strategies that have been prioritized for implementation. Implementation strategies can and should build on the actions recommended in  Phase 3. In this case, rather than asking community members to help brainstorm  adaptation measures, community members can be asked for help supporting and  bolstering implementation and supporting monitoring. During engagement, the  project team can share ongoing progress of adaptation actions and their resulting  benefits. Communities can be sought in the following roles:  Collaborators in education.  Participants and facilitators of tours of adaptation projects as they are implemented.  Recipients of surveys to assess effectiveness and social acceptance.  Receptors or generators of online updates of adaptation progress.  Participants or leaders of pop-up booths at locations illustrating adaptive action  or community events.  Communities can ensure ongoing support for adaptation by maintaining outreach  efforts. Climate adaptation requires ongoing, long-term commitment despite the  changes in elected leaders. When people are informed about and involved in  adaptation strategy development, implementation, and monitoring, they are more  likely to call on local leadership to continue support for that. In the best cases, local  agency staff and local organizations are partners during the implementation process", "636": "MPLEMENTATION FUNDING Strategies must be funded regardless of how they are implemented, or the planning  mechanisms used. Funding and financing sources can include local general funds,  bonds, taxes, assessments, fees, grants, private sector partnerships or investments,  non-profit grants and partnerships, among others. The state has many grant programs  to support location adaptation actions funded through cap-and-trade. The  Adaptation Clearinghouses Investing in Adaptation web page lists many funding  opportunities by adaptation sector and has guidance on conducting fiscal analyses of  adaptation strategies.14 It is regularly updated as funding sources evolve. The California  State Library also lists funding opportunities resulting from recent legislation.15 Climate  Adaptation Finance and Investment in California also has guidance on funding  adaptation measures intended for local government staff. The Regional Resilience  Toolkit includes steps for identifying and gathering adaptation funding sources.16 Some  federal sources, such as FEMAs Hazard Mitigation Grant Funding (HMGP) and Building  Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) programs can be used to fund and  finance adaptation actions. Many communities across California have historically used  federal funding for these activities. Non-profit funding sources may also be available. Local agencies often rely on their general fund for partial or full funding of  implementation since they control it and using it does not rely on local ability to  receive grant funding or raise new capital. However, local agencies often have limited  general funds and competing needs for its use. City of Oakland Community-Based Climate Adaptation  Planning The Pacific Institute report conducted in collaboration with OCAC,  Community-Based Climate Adaptation Planning: Case Study of Oakland,  California, identifies methods of engaging frontline communities in the  implementation processfrom the way that climate change is discussed to  the methods that communities use to participate in implementation.13 Two of  these methods are: 1) an appointed task force of stakeholders from throughout  the community who make recommendations about implementation, and 2)  a community-initiated coalition, that is, a coalition of community groups who  make recommendations collaboratively.June 2020 145 California Adaptation Planning Guide In cases where a community does not have general funds, staff, or other funding  resources to implement all adaptation strategies, it can be helpful to rank strategies  by how important it is to enhancing climate resilience and by the local capacity to  fiscally support implementation (refer to Task 1.2). Strategies can be classified based  on whether current support of a strategy would require 1) no budget adjustment, 2)  reallocation of funds, or 3) new and/or external funding.", "637": "OPRs Climate Adaptation Finance and Investment in California includes a chapter on  funding and financing implementation with guidance for local governments regarding  options for bonds and taxes. It also includes grant programs by sector. It is intended to  provide a survey of issues, considerations and sources of funding that can help guide  strategies and tactics for investing in adaptation and resilience in California.20 In times of economic downturn or limited local budget, collaboration with regional  partners can result in joint planning and resource sharing activities, as well as  cooperative purchasing agreements to support implementation. The Alliance  of Regional Collaboratives for Climate Adaptation (ARCCA) provides ways for  communities in many parts of the state to collaborate, limit costs, and achieve  effective adaptation measure development and implementation. AECOM partnered with Resources Legacy Fund to produce Paying for Climate  Adaptation in California: A Primer for Practitioners, a report that synthesizes information  local decision-makers need when thinking about funding and financing climate  adaptation. The report offers a foundational understanding of existing constraints June 2020 147 California Adaptation Planning Guide and opportunities and recommends ways cities, counties, water districts, utilities, state  agencies, private companies, and other entities can make adaptation and resilience  investments.21 The AECOM report categorizes funding opportunities into:  Grants and assessments. Grants, such as planning grants that help fund  acceleration of affordable housing production and streamline housing approvals,  can be obtained for entities at all levels of government, and assessments rely on  property owner. Both of these require high local capacity.  Taxes. Taxes primarily require payment by property owners. Different taxes are  subject to various rules and requirements but may be a good option for certain  adaptation strategies.  Fees. Fees rely on users to generate the funds to support adaptive measure  implementation. In many cases, there are strict rules regarding where such funds  may be spent.  Private involvement. There are a variety of ways in which the private sector can  be involved; however, there is less consistency between examples save for a  common private investment for public benefit. Resources such as Blue Forest Conservations Forest Resilience Bond, the CECs  Characterizing Uncertain Sea Level Rise Projections to Support Investment Decisions,  Finance Guide for Resilient By Design,22 Transit Resiliency Funding Opportunities,23 and others all provide guidance, suggestions, and ideas to guide funding to support  adaptation strategy implementation. Funding is a dynamic component of adaptation  planning. Many of the foundational funding sources are familiar, such as general  funds; others, such as new grant programs or green bond financing, emerge on  an ongoing basis. Many of the websites and resources summarized in this section,  particularly from the State of California, such as the Adaptation Clearinghouse, allow  communities to track the emergence of these resources.", "638": "In cases where an adaptation strategy requires construction of a physical asset  typically included in a capital investment plan, the asset can be included in the  annual or biennial planning process, which are better equipped for financing larger  projects. An effective way to support implementationwhether using the capital  investment plan or local general fundis to demonstrate the fiscal benefits from  loss avoidance and improved public safety. It is almost always less costly to address  climate impacts or hazards ahead of time rather than responding after they happen.", "639": "Step 4.2: Monitor Climate conditions continually change, as do science, community characteristics,  regulations, technology, and other factors that affect adaptation needs. Monitoring  is critical to ensure that the chosen strategies to address community vulnerability  continue to be as effective as planned. For each adaptation strategy, one  department should be designated as the responsible agency for carrying out  monitoring activities, including storing monitoring data. In many cases, this also  requires designation of a dedicated funding source for monitoring activities. The  responsible agency can be a jurisdictional department, regional entity such as a  council of governments, or a community group. If a community group, a specific  memorandum of understanding should be established between a jurisdictional  department or regional entity and the community group to ensure ongoing data  collection and data quality. There should also be a designated department that  gathers and compiles all the monitoring data from all the monitoring entities to  conduct an overall assessment of effectiveness. Monitoring is the easiest and most cost-effective when using an indicator that is  already collected as part of day-to-day operations. During strategy development  and prioritization (Phase 3), the indicator to be monitored should be identified. It  should reflect the impact being addressed, the desired outcome, and the specifics  of the individual strategy. Identified indicators should be collected at a prespecified  intervalat least annually, although more frequent collection rates may be necessary  (such as event frequency or tide height). Example indicators include signals of the  impact being addressed, such as beach width, mean high tide, flood frequency and  peak flow, or fire frequency and intensity; the desired outcomes, such as asthma rates,  days missed from work or school, air quality, or climate hazard losses; and specifics  of the strategy, such as structural condition of mitigation or days and frequency of  closure or service disruption (roads or other assets).", "640": "MONITORING AND OUTREACH The results of monitoring efforts should  be reported regularly to the public to  maintain awareness of effectiveness and  local adaptation needs. Communities  can publish a regular adaptation report  to the public, place the information on  an interactive website that is regularly  updated, or report the results through  other means. The cities of Encinitas,  Burlingame, and Richmond all provide  examples of municipal efforts for  communicating implementation progress.  This type of transparency is critical to  keeping the community engaged in the  ongoing challenge of adaptation. In  particular, this data should be available  and communicated to community  members who are expected to be most  susceptible to climate-related issues.  Some sample actions are:  Document lessons learned during the planning process and ensure that future  planning processes take the lessons into consideration.  Have a community advisory board lead monitoring and review of the plan, or  partner with a university or college program to do this.   Identify mechanisms for holding agencies and departments accountable.   Use open data online platform approaches to sharing climate, project  implementation, and equity information with community members.", "641": "MONITORING AND OUTREACH The results of monitoring efforts should  be reported regularly to the public to  maintain awareness of effectiveness and  local adaptation needs.

Monitoring is the first step in adjusting to these changes. The monitoring  data should be analyzed and evaluated to identify if and how a strategy no longer  meets community needs. This evaluation should focus on what the community sees as  the goal of the adaptation strategy, so that effectiveness can be assessed based on  community need. When a strategy is identified as losing effectiveness, a series of steps  are needed to plot a path forward. State legislation may also trigger a re-evaluation  of the vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategies. When a strategy loses effectiveness, the vulnerability and susceptibility of the people,  resources, assets, or operations it affects should be reassessed. It is most practical to  keep the focus of the reassessment as narrow as possiblea new, comprehensive  vulnerability assessment is not always necessary. When updating a vulnerability  assessmentwhether individual scores or the entire analysisthe first priority is  to review any scientific updates and changes to community characteristics. The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change updates its periodic summary of climate  science and global adaptive needs every five to seven years.27 The state issues an  updated Safeguarding California Plan periodically with updated science and state  conditions, and conducts a new Climate Change Assessment every few years.28 There  are also many regional assessments emerging from universities and regional agencies  or nongovernmental entities. All these reports may have updated science and other  useful information.  Another source for new or improved data is datasets or studies prepared in the  aftermath of climate-exacerbated hazards, such as fire or flooding. These resources  often combine local social conditions and context with bio-geophysical factors that  contributed to the experienced hazard event. As community planners know, community characteristics change over time. When an  adaptation strategy loses effectiveness, it is critical to assess whether or not changes  in the community have altered the experienced climate change effects, increased  the vulnerability of any populations or assets, or made any additional community  members or assets susceptible. For example, if a growing community has increased its  level of development and associated impervious surfaces, it may have also increased  its flood risk. The community should assess if the escalating risk disproportionately  affects any specific populations or locations. County health departments are a key  community ally in identifying changes to the population characteristics and to overall  health indicators.", "643": "EVALUATION AND OUTREACH Community outreach and education programs about evaluation can be a very  effective way to engage community members in efforts to shift course in adaptation  strategies. Include the public by, at a minimum, disclosing evaluation outcomes  transparently. This leads to a better understanding of the finite nature of any  single adaptation strategy. It is also possible to include community organizations  or committees in the assessment and evaluation of monitoring data. More direct  participation fosters better understanding across more of the community, and it should  include disproportionately affected or frontline communities in these efforts. Some  sample actions are:  Define and regularly measure a series of equity-related indicators.  Develop a reporting system (e.g., online) to communicate results for the equity- related indicators through time.  Ensure clear avenues for recourse and accountability of project implementation.", "644": "tep 4.4: Adjust Evaluation of monitoring data following measure implementation may reveal the need  for adjustment, which could trigger the strengthening of a strategy or an entirely new  approach to the vulnerability. Each strategy should be evaluated carefully to assess  the extent to which it can be bolstered to address increasing impacts of climate  change and the extent to which it precludes strategies that may more effectively  address the impacts. Such assessments should take place during the first couple  of years of implementation of any strategy so that potential strengthening and  compatibility with other strategies are known from the outset, making for smoother  adjustments based on indicator evaluation. For example, strengthening a sea wall or  flood wall may make retreat or accommodation strategies more difficult to pursue;  however, in many cases, initially bolstering a physical barrier can give a community  time to set up strategies that accommodate higher sea or flood levels. Once those are  in place, the physical barrier should give way to the accommodation strategy (see  Table 13). Evaluation of monitoring data can help communities determine when such  transitions should take place. Strengthening a strategy varies widely by strategy, from changing the speed of  implementation, to altering its location, to revising the implementation mechanism.  The changes to strengthen a strategy should be identified as part of the initial  implementation, and the indicator being monitored should be tied to pre-identified  points where strengthening may be required. 152 Phase 4: Implement, Monitor, Evaluate, and Adjust As well as evaluating strategies for the extent to which they can be strengthened, they  should be evaluated for their compatibility with potentially more effective strategies.  In many cases the strategies that are potentially more effective take longer or cost  more to implement, making them better suited to be a longer-term strategy that can  be implemented after priority strategies are put into effect. Choosing when to shift to  the longer-term strategy is more easily managed when specific triggers for the shift are  identified ahead of time (see Table 13). Table 13.

Data.census.gov is an online database hosted  by the US Census Bureau that allows users to view, download, and map results from  the decennial census, the annual American Community Survey, and other specialized  surveys and analyses carried out by the Census Bureau. This updated database also  includes a mapping feature that allows planners to visually display the results of the  data. Adaptation planners can use data.census.gov to understand the demographic  and other socioeconomic characteristics of a community, such as how many residents  belong to a particular frontline community. US Climate Resilience Toolkit. The US Climate Resilience Toolkit is a set of national  resources to assist practitioners in conducting climate adaptation work. It provides a  number of tools for looking up climate changerelated data, guidance documents on  the climate adaptation process, and case studies on improving resiliency. The Climate  Resilience Toolkit also includes videos and other training modules on adaptation- related topics. The toolkit is a program of the United States Global Change Research  Program. Regional Resilience Toolkit. The Regional Resilience Toolkit, prepared by FEMA and  EPA in partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission/Association of  Bay Area Governments, is a toolkit to help with regional disaster planning across  multiple jurisdictions and with non-governmental partners. This toolkit provides a 5-step  process with helpful worksheets and outreach materials, to help communities plan for  resilience, or move from planning to action. NOAAs Digital Coast is a comprehensive platform for data, tools, and training for  communities to address coastal issues. One-way adaptation-related resources can be  accessed on the site by topic area, including adaptation strategies, coastal economy,  coastal land cover, coastal storms, natural infrastructure, risk communication,  vulnerability assessments, and water quality. This website provides data, information,  and technical support that can be applied in California at state, regional, and local  levels.C-6 Appendix C: Adaptation Planning Resources  Federal Highway Administration Nature-Based Solutions. The Federal Highway  Administration provides resources, pilot studies, webinars, and examples of nature- based solutions that help protect coastal highways from sea level rise, flooding, and  coastal erosion. The implementation guide provides best practices for how and where  nature-based and hybrid solutions can be used to improve the resilience of coastal  roads and bridges. This resource also provides research and technical assistance from  transportation practitioners across the country. Guidance for Considering the Use of Living Shorelines. Guidance for Considering  the Use of Living Shorelines was developed in 2015 by NOAA to provide insight on  implementing a living shoreline along estuarine coasts, bays, and tributaries. The  guidance document provides information for addressing shoreline erosion through  natural solutions that add stability. It also discusses NOAAs role in reviewing living  shoreline projects in critical habitat, essential fish habitat, or protected areas. Nongovernmental Resources Climate Adaptation Knowledge Exchange. The Climate Adaptation Knowledge  Exchange (CAKE) was launched in 2010 as a shared knowledge base for managing  the natural and built systems in the face of climate change. CAKE includes case  studies and documents from across the world. This resource also includes several tribal  nation examples in the United States. Guide to Equitable Community-Driven Climate Preparedness Planning. The Guide to  Equitable Community-Driven Climate Preparedness Planning, prepared by the Urban  Sustainability Directors Network in 2017, provides guidance on how to complete an  equitable climate adaptation planning process. This guide provides background  on inequities in planning, as well as a framework conducting an inclusive climate  preparedness process. Table 8 of this guide demonstrates considerations and  strategies that can be integrated into climate adaptation measures to account for  social and climate justice inequities in communities. Making Equity Real in Climate Adaptation and Community Resilience Policies  and Programs: A Guidebook The Greenlining Institute aims to advance economic  opportunity and empowerment for people of color through advocacy, community  building, and leadership development. This guidebook prioritizes the climate  adaptation and community resilience needs of frontline communities and offers  planning staff a step-by-step process for defining equity in measurable factors in  policies and grant programs. These steps include embedding equity in the mission,  vision, and values; building equity in the process; ensuring equitable outcomes; and  measuring and analyzing for equity.June 2020 C-7 California Adaptation Planning Guide Healthy Places Index. The Healthy Places Index, developed by the Public Health  Alliance of Southern California, is an interactive mapping tool that combines 25  community characteristics into a weighted score that ranks census tracts across  California for conditions that support health. It displays some climate change  exposures, sensitivities, and adaptive capacities in decision support layers to assist in  assessing climate and health vulnerability and planning for policy changes to support  community resilience. Mapping Resilience: A Blueprint for Thriving in the Face of Climate Disasters Mapping Resilience, prepared by the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, aims  to raise the public visibility of the needs of frontline communities within statewide  climate adaptation and resilience efforts. For adaptation planning, the report  provides research and resources on communities disproportionately impacted by  climate changerelated disasters in California and lessons learned from examples  across the US; key existing indicators, data, tools, and analytical frameworks for  understanding the intersection of climate impacts, health and well-being outcomes,  socioeconomic vulnerability, and adaptive capacity factors; and lessons learned from  development and use of indicators in related fields (e.g., public health, environmental  justice, and land use).  Community-Driven Climate Resilience Planning Framework. Community-Driven  Climate Resilience Planning Framework was developed by the Movement Strategy  Center and community-based organizations across the country to strengthen climate  adaptation efforts through culturally relevant, democratic processes with meaningful  community engagement. The primary audience of this resource is community-based  organizations developing, advocating for, and implementing climate solutions;  however, local government staff can use this resource to help increase cross-sector  collaboration and increase the communitys voice and leadership role in the  adaptation process. Coastal Adaptation Policy Briefs. The Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions developed  a set of Coastal Adaptation Policy Briefs that provide engineering, financial, and legal  and regulatory solutions for coastal resources. Each policy brief introduces coastal  adaptation strategy, describes trade-offs and any legal considerations, and illustrates  examples of projects along the California coast. The financial resources include  buyout programs, conservation easements, geologic hazard abatement districts, and  transfer of development rights solutions.C-8 Appendix C: Adaptation Planning Resources  Tribal Climate Change Adaptation Planning Template. This toolkit, developed by the  Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals, contains templates and other resources  to support tribal climate change efforts. It includes guidance on procedures and  methods, worksheets for identifying the potential harm posed by climate change and  developing policies in response to these vulnerabilities, and guidance for thinking  about effective implementation. The toolkit also contains a list of tribal climate change  assessments and adaptation plans from several different states.", "653": "This guidebook is intended to assist managers  and planners in Californias coastal cities and  counties in developing sea level rise adaptation  plans for their communities. State agency staff who work with these issues may also find it useful. It begins with an introduction that provides back- ground information about climate change and sea  level rise and an explanation of why planners in  coastal communities should begin to plan for sea  level rise and the associated coastal hazards.", "654": "The procedures and approaches that are outlined  in the Guide are informed by work with two of  Californias coastal communities, Santa Cruz and  Santa Barbara. For Santa Cruz, a general Climate  Change Vulnerability Study was completed and a  Climate Change Adaptation Plan has been written.  A Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment was  prepared for the city of Santa Barbara during the  process of Guide development, so that this Guide  could be informed by an actual case study. The ap- proaches to adaptation that are described in the  following pages serve as examples of processes  that may not suit all communities. Local govern- ments should feel free to adjust the suggested  approaches and methods accordingly. We are en- tering uncharted territory here, and communities  can learn from each other about what works and  what does not, and coordinate their efforts and re- sponses on a regional basis. Also, pulling together a Sea Level Rise Prepared- ness Team (explained in Chapter 2), conducting  a vulnerability study, preparing a hazard and risk  assessment, selecting appropriate adaptation  measures, obtaining funding and implementing  adaptation plans may be more complicated than  they appear to be here, especially for very large  communities.", "655": "Worldwide, over 200 million people globally are  vulnerable to short-term elevated sea level events  or flooding (Nichols, 2010).

At Crescent City, for example, along  the northern California coast, the local NOAA tide  gauge records show a drop in sea level of two  inches, or 0.65 mm/yr since 1933 when the gauge  was first installed (Figure 2.3). The northern Cali- fornia and southern Oregon coasts are both being  uplifted due to tectonic activity, which proceeds  in those locations today at a rate greater than the  rate of global sea level rise. However, the far north  coast is the only place along Californias shoreline  where sea level is currently dropping relative to  the land surface.", "658": "Beginning in 1992, several satellites have been  launched with the capability of measuring the  level of the ocean from space very accurately. The  18 years of data that have been collected to date  are free of the effects of vertical land movements that can affect tide gauge measurements. They indicate that the global rate of sea level rise has  increased to a little over three millimeters per year  between 1993 and 2010 (Figure 2.4).  Recent research and climate change analysis in- dicate that the rate of sea level rise will likely ac- celerate during the coming decades as ocean wa- ter continues to warm and expand and as the ice  sheets and glaciers of Greenland and West Antarc- tica break up more rapidly than were previously  anticipated. ", "659": "By the year 2100, mean sea level may rise by as  much as 40 to 55 inches (1 to 1.4 meters) along  the coast of California, although these projections  are being modified as observations continue to be made and additional data become available. The  California Ocean Protection Council, working with  the Coast and Ocean Climate Action Team (CO- CAT), which consists of representatives from 15  different state agencies, have adopted interim sea level rise projections for the decades ahead using  the high scenarios in all cases for 2030, 2050, 2070  and 2100 (Table 2.1).  Rates of sea level rise are region-specific because long-term land motion influences sea level at any individual location. In California, sea level has been  measured historically at 14 different tide gauge stations between San Diego and Crescent City, al- though two of these stations were discontinued  during the 1990s (Table 2.2). Eight of the stations  have at least 50 years of data, and the oldest sta- tion at San Francisco has been in operation since  1857 (Table 2.2)", "660": "The States two northernmost stations record the  complex land motion along the northern Califor- nia coast, just offshore of Cape Mendocino, where three large tectonic plates come together. At  Humboldt Bays North Spit, sea level is rising by  18.6 inches per century (4.73 millimeters per year),  the highest rate in California (Figure 2.6). Just 80  miles north at Crescent City, sea level is dropping  relative to the coastline by 2.5 inches per century  (0.65 millimeters per year) (Figure 2.6). The shore- line at Humboldt Bay is subsiding, whereas Cres- cent Citys coastline is rising.", "661": "A vulnerability assessment is the first step in the process of developing an informed sea level rise  adaptation plan (Figure 3.1). Assessing a commu- nitys vulnerability to sea level rise needs to con- sider three factors: 1] the probable magnitude of  sea level rise and its associated impacts; 2] the  sensitivity or exposure of the planning area to  sea level rise and future storm and wave impacts; Page 11 and 3] the ability of the community to adapt or re- spond to the anticipated impacts. A vulnerability assessment should include an  evaluation of the degree of a communitys expo- sure to various shoreline hazards as well as the  magnitude of the impact in the case of a signifi- cant event, such as a large El Nio storm or storm  surge that elevates sea level significantly. In turn, adaptation is the adjustment of natural or human  systems to actual or expected phenomena or their  effects, such that it minimizes damage or harm. A coastal communitys adaptive capacity is defined by its ability to respond to sea level rise and oth- er coastal hazards. This includes the reduction or  moderation of potential damages and coping with  their expected or predicted consequences", "662": "One approach for conducting a coastal haz- ards vulnerability assessment is to form a  Sea Level Rise/Coastal Hazard Preparedness Team  (abbreviated the Team), which can be a formal or  informal group. The quality, value and acceptance  of any adaptation plan ultimately depends upon  the involvement and buy-in of the directors of the  public agencies that stand to be affected by sea level rise and associated impacts. Political lead- ers and/or elected officials will also need to be on board prior to plan completion and adoption.", "663": "Team makeup may vary according to a commu- nitys size, resources and vulnerability to sea level  rise. The Team could involve or include local gov- ernment staff from economic development, emer- gency response agencies, parks and recreation,  planning and zoning, transportation, public works  including flood control, wastewater treatment, water supply, and port and harbor management,  or some combination of these that is appropriate  for the individual city or county. Other potential  team members may include consultants, scientific advisors, or members of the business community.  Depending on the formality of the group, the com- position of the Team might change as it moves  through the vulnerability assessment process. It is  possible that sea level rise will affect more sectors of a community than the Team initially realizes,  so members may be added. On the other hand,  some members may not be needed if the assess- ment reveals less vulnerability in certain sectors  than anticipated.", "664": "Team makeup may vary according to a commu- nitys size, resources and vulnerability to sea level  rise.

A more efficient and effective approach for sea level rise planning is to utilize a consultant or consulting firm work- ing with a small group of key city or county agency  staff. A carefully selected consultant or consulting firm should have expertise and experience in the rel- evant issues (climate change and sea level rise,  coastal processes and hazards, for example), a  strong track record of working successfully with  coastal communities, and the time necessary for  completing the entire planning process within a  finite period. In this case, the Team may consist of the consultant and several key local govern- ment department staff, using other staff members as resources for providing input and information  about specific issues, reviewing draft documents and assisting with the editing and preparation of  a final plan. Local ownership of the final adapta- tion plan is important and a good reason for on- going involvement of the local government staff. It is easier to put a consultants report on a shelf  and forget about it, in contrast to ignoring what a  group of city or county staff people worked hard on, come to believe in, and are passionate about.  ", "667": "Regardless of the selected approach, a Sea  Level Rise/Coastal Hazard Preparedness Team  (the Team) will need to carry out the following  tasks as part of the Sea Level Rise Vulnerability As- sessment (Figure 3.1). These will each be explained  in subsequent sections. Additional steps follow  after the local governing body approves the Plan,  although these would fall to the local agency that  has responsibility for plan implementation:  1. Conduct an assessment to determine which  areas are most vulnerable to future flooding, inundation and erosion or damage from sea  level rise, a changing wave climate, and related  processes. Task A. Collect all information on communitys  historical vulnerability to and damage from  coastal hazards. TASKS OF A SEA LEVEL RISE/COASTAL HAZARD PREPAREDNESS TEAM Figure 3.1.

There may be  local summaries, reports, maps and often pho- tographs on file in county planning, public works or other local agencies, but also photographic re- cords and accounts or stories in local newspaper  archives, natural history museums or libraries, or  on websites.  Colleges or universities, state or federal agen- cies have often conducted post-storm or post- disaster investigations that have been assembled  into reports or publications that can be very use-", "673": "Gathering historic sea level data is one of the  most important steps in assessing vulnerability  to future sea level rise. There are two components  of sea level that are important to any individual city  or county: 1] the extreme sea levels or tidal eleva- tions that have been recorded in the past, and will  likely occur in the future, 2] the long-term rate at  which relative sea level is rising in your region.  The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Ad- ministration (NOAA) provides current information  about regional sea level, both extreme historic lev- els and also trends in sea level rise that come from  its tide gauges. These combine data about ocean  level fluctuations and vertical land motion at a number of locations along Californias coastline. An  important consideration in the use of these data is  the time period covered by the closest gauge(s) to  a particular community. The time period should be  long enough (ideally 30-40 years or more) to distin- guish short-term and decadal variations from long- term trends.  Visit: http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_ states.shtml?region=ca to view local mean sea level rise  trends for all NOAA tidal gauge stations in Califor- nia.  Task A. Collect all Information on Communitys Historical Vulnerability to Coastal Hazards ful. Some of the most convincing evidence of the  threats posed by future sea level rise and coastal  storms are written accounts, maps of affected or damaged areas, or photographs of past events.  Such records make it clear that these events have  occurred in the past and will occur again, although  most likely with greater frequency and intensity.  Appendix B includes a listing of all of the major El  Nio events to impact the California coast from  1912 - 1994 (Storlazzi & Griggs, 2000). This is a  good starting point for checking on historical re- cords or specific dates in newspaper archives to see what local impacts or damages may have re- sulted from these events. Task B. Obtain Sea Level Information While sporting goods store or surf shop tide tables  provide reasonable estimates of the expected el- evations of the high and low tides each day, up to  a year in advance, a number of oceanographic or  meteorological processes can raise regional sea  level significantly above the predicted tidal eleva- tions. El Nios, low atmospheric pressure, strong  storms and large waves can all raise sea level above  predicted elevations for hours to weeks (Figures  2.5 and 3.2). A subsequent section on Temporary  Increases in Sea Level During El Nio Events or  Storms will explain this in more detail.  Over at least the next 30 to 40 years, it is these  short-term events that will likely present the great- est flooding and inundation hazards to coastal communities, rather than the more gradual long- term rise in sea level. The NOAA website for each  tide gauge or water level recorder will contain  information on the extremes recorded each year  and how much they exceeded the predicted high  tides at those sites.  The historic record of sea level change for each  station can serve as useful minimum baselines  or starting points for projecting future sea level", "674": "ort-term increases in sea level during storms  or El Nio events will have greater immediate  impacts and may be of greater concern to infra- structure and coastal development during the  next 30 to 40 years than will gradual, more per- manent sea level rise and inundation, barring very  rapid increases in the rate of rise. Most of the ma- jor historic storm damage to Californias coastline  has occurred during El Nio storms, which were  especially devastating during 1982-83 and 1997-98  (Figures 3.4 and 3.5).  Sea levels along the states coastline often rise sub- stantially, ~12 inches or more (albeit temporarily),  during El Nios, when the Eastern Pacific Ocean is warmer than usual and westerly wind patterns  are strengthened. The 1982-83 and 1997-98 El Nio  events caused hundreds of millions of dollars in  storm damage to private and public property as  well as infrastructure, due to the combination of  temporarily elevated sea levels and large storm  waves, which in 1983 repeatedly coincided with  high tides (Figure 3.6 and Figure 3.7; Griggs and  Brown, 1998; Griggs, et al. 2005). In late January 1983, sea levels were the highest  that had ever been recorded in San Diego, Los An- geles and San Francisco, at 9.6, 12.2 and 18.7 inches  above the predicted high tide levels, respectively.  Gauges at Monterey and Crescent City also re- corded the highest sea levels that had ever been  ", "675": "averages of the highest projected sea level rise  values for 2030 (5-8 inches), 2050 (10-17 inches)  and 2100 (40-55 inches). It is recommended that  local communities use these projections in their  planning until the updated values that will be de- veloped by the National Research Councils Sea  Level Rise Committee are completed in 2012. When evaluating the possible consequences of  global sea level rise for their community, a Team  could handle the future uncertainty by perform- ing a sea level rise hazards assessment by using a  few different projected future sea level rise sce- narios and different time frames. Planning Teams that are faced with limited resources, or for other  reasons, may also consider the implementation of  plans that allow for incremental adaptation, per- haps in 25 or 30-year increments, as sea level rise  is likely to occur gradually.", "676": "and San Diego (Figures 3.2A, B, C). Adding these  periodic El Nio changes to gradual sea level rise  and high tides will present increasing risks for low- lying coastal development.", "677": "reached at those stations. The magnitude and sig- nificance of temporarily elevated sea levels rela- tive to long-term sea level rise are evident in the  tide gauge records for San Francisco, Los Angele", "678": "department or other agency files. Maps, photo- graphs, water level measurements or other infor- mation from past El Nio or other damaging coast- al events should be collected and can inform the  vulnerability assessment process. Those shoreline  areas affected or damaged during past storm or el- evated sea level events will most likely be the first to be affected during future incidents as sea level continues to rise (Figure 3.8).", "679": "While sea level has risen over time, average  wave heights have also gradually increased  during the last several decades along the west  coast. Long-term wave data from buoys located  off of the coasts of California, Oregon and Wash- ington provide evidence of increasing offshore wave heights (Ruggiero, et al, 2010). While it is not  yet certain whether these increased wave heights  are related to warming of the oceans, there is a  high probability that these phenomena are relat- ed. The causes for increased wave heights are not  agreed upon yet, but they might include changes  in storm tracks, higher wind speeds, increasingly  intense winter storms, or other factors. During the 22-year period from 1980 to 2002, the  average wave height increased by 1.5 feet along  Figure 3.8. Inundation of East Cliff Drive at Twin Lakes State Beach in Santa Cruz during elevated sea levels, high tides and storm waves in February 1998 (Photo: David Revell). the central California coast (Storlazzi and Wing- field, 2005). It is also important to keep in mind that these wave heights are based on the 22-year  record between 1980 and 2002 but the trend is for  increasing heights, so these values may continue  to increase over time. Seymour (2011) summarized evidence for changes  in the Northeast Pacific wave climate by analyzing the number of occurrences of waves with average  heights that were greater than 20 feet (6 meters).  He divided the data into two 12-year periods (1984- 1995 and 1996-2007) and found that for the area  from Pt. Conception to the Oregon border, there  is a substantial increase in the number of occur- rences of these large waves between the first and the second time periods (Figure 3.9).", "680": "Most communities along the California coast  were negatively affected by three El Nio winters: 1978, 1983 and 1997-98. There are state- wide inventories of both impacts and damage  (California Coastal Commission, 1978; Domurat,  1978; Swisher, 1983; Griggs and Johnson, 1983;  Seymour, 1998; Storlazzi and Griggs, 1998). Local  accounts typically are reported in local newspa- pers or are in the files of public works, planning", "681": "Changes in the wave climate along southern Cali- fornia (from Pt. Conception to the Mexican bor- der) are less pronounced than they are along the  central and northern California coastline. In the  1984 to 1995 period, there were 7 storm events  with waves 16 feet or higher and 4 events that re- sulted in wave heights of 20 feet or higher. Dur- ing the 1996 to 2010 period, however, there were  69 events that resulted in wave heights of 16 feet  or greater and 10 events that resulted in wave  heights of 20 feet or greater (Figure 3.10). Coastal storms are expected to continue to in- crease in frequency and intensity during the com- ing decades (Barnard, et al, 2011). When increas- ingly large waves are combined with a gradually  rising sea level, we can expect an increase in the  frequency of the flooding of low-lying areas (Fig- ure 3.11) and an increased risk and rate of coastal  cliff retreat. Although wave characteristics may change in unknown ways in the future, their pat- terns over the past several decades have been  well documented.  The effects of storm waves upon the coast are not new to California, which has been battered fre- quently during the recent past (Figures. 3.12 and  3.13). Rather, these effects are likely to be exacer- bated by rising sea levels.", "682": "The next step in assessing a communitys vul- nerability to sea level rise is to map areas of  potential future coastal flooding and inundation. The impact of future sea level rise is dependent  upon the level of the ocean at various times in the  future, the topography or elevation of shoreline  areas, and the degree of development or amount  of infrastructure.  ", "683": "By establishing a baseline that shows how storm- related hazards have affected a communitys shoreline planning areas in the past, a Team can  begin to envision how increasingly severe or fre- quent hazards might affect the same areas in the future. It will therefore be better positioned to  monitor and respond to those changes as they oc- cur. Individual or community disaster memories of- ten are short, and photographs or maps of historic  damage or coastal flooding will serve as important reminders of past events for todays planning. A useful initial step for any coastal community  would be for the Team to compile its own his- tory of coastal storm damage over the past 50 or  100 years in order to illustrate to elected officials, agency staff and others that the events to be ex- pected during the future are not necessarily new,  but they will most likely occur with greater fre- quency and intensity than in the past.  There are general databases of past storm his- tory along the California coast that are helpful for  such a compilation (see Griggs and Johnson, 1983;  Griggs and Fulton-Bennett, 1987). Storlazzi and  Griggs (2000) compiled a history of El Nio events  that occurred during the last century. It provides  a good starting point for a search of local records  (newspaper archives, for example) to find evi- dence and documentation of historic storm dam- age. Appendix B lists the major El Nio events by  their relative intensity or severity. ", "684": "The interaction of the physical processes that  produce cliff erosion or retreat, (i.e. wave impact, rainfall and runoff, earthquakes, etc.), with the dif- ferent types of rocks that are exposed along the  coast, has resulted in wide-ranging erosion rates  along Californias 1,100-mile coastline. At some  sites, such as the Monterey peninsula, cliff erosion has been negligible for the 75100 years because  the granite is very hard and resistant to wave at- tack. Ten miles north along the sandy bluffs of southern Monterey Bay, the average rate of re- treat ranges from two to seven feet per year. In  general, weak sedimentary rocks such as the sand- stone, siltstone, mudstone and shale that form  much of Californias coastline, retreat at long-term  average rates of a few inches to a foot or more per  year. Coastal erosion tends to be episodic, however,  with much of the long-term cliff and bluff failure taking place during a few severe storm events ev- ery 5 or 10 years. The arrival of large storm waves at  times of high tides and elevated sea levels, which  frequently occur during major El Nio events, can  produce severe coastal erosion in areas that were  formerly thought to be relatively stable.  Although the average long-term rate of retreat of  the cliffs in Capitola has been about one foot per year, large slabs may collapse overnight, moving  the cliff edge back by 5 to 10 feet, followed by little change for a number of years (Figure 3.22). Short- term cliff erosion rates are often very different from long-term (3050 year) averages and need  to be viewed with caution (Lester, 2005).", "685": "A recommended starting point in assessing future  coastal erosion hazards in a community is to com- pile all of the existing erosion information for your  city or county coastline. There are several sources  for these data, including both site-specific studies as well as regional or statewide compilations.  Most development or re-development proposals  for cliff or bluff-top parcels in California are re- quired to undertake geological and/or geotechni- cal investigations that evaluate cliff stability and retreat rates. These reports should all be on file in Planning Departments by parcel number and they  could be assembled in a GIS base.  The California Coastal Commission recently com- pleted a statewide project that compiled all of the  coastal erosion data in their files from consultant reports into a single database. That information  is publicly available on a CD and it provides a valu- able resource of existing erosion rate data (Dare,  2005).  Living with the Changing California Coast (Griggs,  et al. 2005), includes mile-by-mile hazard maps for  the entire coast of California, including erosion  rates where available. Geologists familiar with  specific areas wrote individual regional chapters and identified and described specific hazardous areas.  Depending upon the extent of coverage of the  existing erosion rate data for a particular city or  county and the extent of undeveloped ocean- front land remaining, there may be a need for and  value in performing a cliff erosion study in order to fill in any gaps. Most coastal cities and counties are already well  aware of the areas within their jurisdictions that  are subject to cliff or bluff erosion problems. The municipalities probably already have building set- back procedures or guidelines in place, as well  as requirements for geological or geotechnical  investigations prior to issuing building permits.  A study of coastal hazard policies for the states  coastal cities and counties completed 20 years ", "686": "ago, however, determined that there was consid- erable variation in how local governments dealt  with issues such as setbacks for cliff and bluff con- struction (Griggs, et al, 1992). Each city and county should begin by re-evaluating  their existing cliff and bluff setback requirements, and the historic erosion rate data to determine  which parcels and structures are located within  setback zones or areas likely to be affected by cliff retreat at specific future times (e.g. 2030, 2050, 2100).  ", "687": "The final step in assessing risk involves evaluat- ing a coastal communitys adaptive capacity,  because its vulnerability to sea level rise depends  not only upon physical stressors to the local shore- line but also on the ability of affected areas to adapt to those changes (NOAA, 2010). The Team  Chapter4 Risk AssessmentPage 30 Adapting to Sea Level Rise: A Guide for Californias Coastal Communities must determine which adaptation options are  available while considering the likelihood that the  highest projected sea level rise may prevail. (See  the following chapter for information about ad- aptation strategies.) The types of effects to be ex- pected as a result of sea level rise, the potential  costs of adaptation, and the longevity of various  adaptation options need to be considered as well.  Adaptive capacity may be described in terms of  a communitys ability to prepare for, respond to,  and recover from sea level rise impacts. A Team  should evaluate the following: 1. regulatory and planning capabilities (e.g., de- velopment restrictions, coastal management  regulations, hazard mitigation, sustainability,  shoreline management, post-disaster recov- ery/emergency plans, etc.); 2. administrative and technical capabilities (e.g.,  the number of sea level rise experts, planners,  engineers, GIS and mapping resources and  modeling capabilities, etc.); 3. fiscal capacity (e.g., taxes, bonds, grants, im- pact fees, withholding spending in hazard  zones and insurance); and 4. infrastructure (e.g., flood and erosion control structures, evacuation routes and redundant  water, wastewater and power systems) . As with the determination of a coastlines vulner- ability to sea level rise, it is helpful to use scenario  planning when determining a coastal communitys  adaptive capacity. A Team should develop a range  of plausible sea level rise outcomes (probabilities  and consequences) based on multiple points in  time (e.g. 2030, 2050 and 2100) and multiple sea  level projections in order to provide a basis for  further adaptation planning. It is recommended  to use the projections for future sea level rise that  are currently employed by Californias state agen- cies: 5-8 inches by 2030, 10-17 inches of sea level  rise by the year 2050 and 40-55 inches by 2100, or  the values that will be developed by the Nation- al Research Councils Sea Level Rise Committee.  Each completed scenario should include quanti- tative projections of future sea level rise and de- scriptions of the potential associated impacts and  consequences.", "688": "Adaptive capacity may be described in terms of  a communitys ability to prepare for, respond to,  and recover from sea level rise impacts.", "689": "After priorities (such as reducing risks to critical  infrastructure from future sea level rise) are  clearly identified, a Team can define its adaptation goals. Goals should establish desired endpoints by  stating the preferred long-term outcomes of ad- aptation to sea level rise. Some examples of goals  include the following (NRC, 2010): 1. a plan or time line for phased relocation of ex- isting infrastructure or public facilities away  from vulnerable areas, 2. site and design all future public works projects  to take into account projections for sea level  rise, 3. eliminate public subsidies for future develop- ment in high hazard coastal areas, 4. prioritize critical public infrastructure for ret- rofitting/protection (storm water/wastewa- ter systems, energy facilities, roads, bridges,  ports), 5. potential removal of barriers to landward mi- gration of heavily used public beaches and es- tuaries/wetlands, 6. develop strategic property acquisition pro- grams to discourage development in hazard- prone areas; encourage relocation; and allow  inland migration of coastal habitats, 7. discourage placement of shoreline armoring  and encourage alternatives, and 8. encourage sustainable forms of development  (such as clustered or higher density develop- ment in low-risk areas).", "690": "PLAN OBJECTIVES AND ACTION MEASURES I t is important to note that the most successful  long-term coastal management programs set  unambiguous, quantifiable, time-bounded objec- tives, (in contrast to vague or open-ended goals).  Specific geographic areas that are of the highest risk, (either due to their low elevations or proximi- ties to retreating cliffs), should be mapped and de- lineated, and timelines should be established for  actions that are based on agreed-upon conditions  or thresholds. For example, by the time high tides  reach a certain elevation, a relocation plan has  been established and action is initiated. Further- more, when a retreating cliff or bluff edge erodes to within a certain distance of a street, sidewalk,  sewer or water line, a clear retreat plan has been  approved. The team should remember to focus primar- ily upon planned or proactive adaptation, as op- posed to reactive adaptation. Reactive adapta- tion includes changes in policy and behaviors that  people and organizations adopt after changes in  coastal risks are observed or communities have  already sustained damage. For example, as prop- erty losses from increasing wave heights and in- creasingly severe coastal storms and sea level  rise increase in frequency, insurance companies  will likely raise their rates or drop coverage alto- gether, resulting in a disincentive to live in hazard  zones. This has already begun to happen along the  hurricane-prone barrier islands that line the South  Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The  purpose of adapting to sea level rise, though, is to  avoid such problems altogether by planning ahead  for the future. In this way, planned adaptation is  intentional, rational, and it aims to address the full  range of sea level rise hazards such that it meets  societal objectives", "691": "A range of criteria may be used for selecting the  best adaptation options for a particular coastal  community. These include actual effectiveness, cost and benefit, ease of design and implementa- tion, and public and political acceptability. Each  potential adaptation measure should be reviewed  individually using those criteria or guidelines. The  Team should recommend to decision-makers the  choices that are most likely to be successfully im- plemented. These may be the most cost-effective, easiest to implement, or most politically accept- able choices.", "692": "There are three different types of future plan- ning or adaptation considerations for coastal  properties in most cities or counties:  1. Undeveloped parcels that are considered or  are zoned to be developable.  2. Existing unprotected development, including  residential and commercial areas as well as in- frastructure (i.e. streets, parking lots, parks,  bike paths, sewer or water lines, etc.). 3. Existing development that has already been  armored. A Team should be aware of the different adapta- tion strategies that are available for both existing  and planned future development. Some communi- ties have highly developed coastlines, while oth- ers that have some undeveloped land could take  advantage of the opportunity to address potential  future issues proactively. Undeveloped land pres- ents the easiest opportunity for planning ahead  or adapting to future sea level rise when taking  into account the very high probability of increased  rates of coastal erosion.  Combining historical cliff or bluff erosion rates with the projected lifespan of any future develop- ADAPTATION STRATEGIES: UNDEVELOPED VS. DEVELOPED LAND ment has been the most common method of de- termining a safe setback distance from an eroding  cliff or bluff edge. However, an increased erosion rate or safety factor needs to be considered, al- though there is not yet an agreed upon statewide  method or value for this. A conservative approach  is strongly recommended. Considering the State- adopted rate of future sea level rise and high prob- ability of inundation or increased cliff or bluff ero- sion, it is the responsibility of an applicant and/or  their consultant to make a case for the safety of a  proposed structure during its lifetime.", "693": "Possible strategies for new, planned development  include mandatory setbacks to restrict develop- ment in vulnerable areas, required warning notic- es to developers and buyers regarding the poten- tial impacts of future sea level rise or cliff retreat, smart growth and clustered development in low- risk areas, and the development of expendable or  mobile structures in vulnerable areas. The word  resiliency is often used to describe a possible  approach to development or land uses in hazard- ous zones. While public lands such as undeveloped  parks, parking lots, bicycle or jogging trails could  be considered resilient, because they can recover  after being flooded or covered with debris follow- ing large storms, it appears that very little private", "694": "coastal development can be considered resilient  or capable of withstanding rising sea level, inunda- tion or wave impact without serious damage.", "695": "An additional issue to consider is the difference between public and private property. A local  Team will probably find that dealing with private property can be far more difficult than dealing ADAPTATION STRATEGIES: PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE PROPERTY with public property. This may be an uphill battle,  but in the long run, the costs of restricting or limit- ing new development in recognized hazard areas  (such as eroding sea cliffs or low-lying areas sub- Chapter5 Developing an Adaptation PlanPage 36 Adapting to Sea Level Rise: A Guide for Californias Coastal Communities ject to flooding or inundation) would be far lower than the costs of dealing with damaged or immi- nently threatened development. For existing private development in vulnerable  areas, strategies for addressing sea level rise im- pacts include: 1. Planned retreat or relocation incentives from  high-risk areas. Establish mandatory rolling  setbacks for any future development or sig- nificant redevelopment in areas that are likely to be affected by sea level rise or cliff retreat within the anticipated lifetime of the structure. 2. Develop a plan and policies and identify fund- ing or tax incentives for purchasing or relocat- ing existing structures out of areas that are  subject to future sea level rise or cliff erosion. 3. Restrict the rebuilding of vulnerable structures  that have been damaged by storms and/or  damage due to sea level rise. 4. Evaluate presently armored areas to deter- mine whether additional armor or retreat is  the most practical long-term approach. 5. Reduce and eliminate dependence on armor- ing (although there may be some critical struc- tures where armoring may provide short to  intermediate-term protection until other solu- tions can be implemented).  For existing public infrastructure or community  resources, whether they be roads, parks, parking  areas, sewer lines or sewage pumping stations: 1. seawalls may provide short-term protection,  depending upon their specific locations and el- evations, but 2. removal and relocation or replacement strate- gies should be regarded as the most effective long-term solutions. Develop retreat orretrofit plans for existing infrastructure that is subject  to future inundation. 3. Design and site all future city or county proj- ects and infrastructure to account for sea level  rise predictions based upon the projected life- spans of the projects. The critical question for each facility or structure  is: Based on the consideration of all of the costs  and benefits as well as the risks, at what point should a community take action? A shoreline  park or parking lot can be used intermittently for  a long time with periodic winter inundation, but a  sewer line or pumping station at beach elevation  must be relocated or replaced well in advance of  flooding or failure", "696": "Before developing final policies, the Team should ensure that is has the support of those  who have the largest stakes in coastal adaptation,  including those elected officials who must ulti- mately approve and stand behind the plan. Open  public meetings can be used to educate the gen- eral public, coastal property owners and elected  officials about the need for an adaptation plan by presenting the impacts and hazards of sea level  rise, the history of past storm and flooding dam- age, future vulnerabilities, and options for recom- mended adaptation approaches.", "697": "Carrying out an adaptation plan requires fund- ing, not only for its initial implementation but  also for periodic updates, since sea level rise is not  a process that will cease at a certain level or on a  specific date in the future. Securing funding may be easiest during times when adaptation to sea  level rise is required by legislation and already on  the agenda of a local government or political body.  Typically, most action or legislation regarding nat- ural hazards takes place immediately following a  large and damaging event and then collective  amnesia sets in and other issues become higher  priorities than sea level rise adaptation planning.  Good examples include the 1989 Loma Prieta  earthquake, and the tsunamis resulting from the  2006 earthquake in Sumatra and in Japan in 2011.  As time passes, funding for area-wide adaptation,  for the execution of regulatory measures and  for those measures requiring large capital invest- ments and follow-up monitoring may be difficult to secure. Some responses to this challenge in- clude tapping into existing complementary organi- zations, (such as coastal management programs),  merging new adaptation policies with planned  coastal development for resilience, and exploring  the use of tourist or user fees", "698": "ONITORING PLAN EFFECTIVENESS One of the most important requirements for  sustained long-term implementation is scien- tific credibility. For example, the general reason- ing in favor of a setback or buffer zone must be backed by data analysis that compares past, cur- rent and projected future sea level rise trends and  the resulting inundation for the areas of concern.  A map that depicts the historic landward migra- tion of a shoreline or bluff edge over time stands as clear evidence that the California coastline is  not static or stationary, and that it is experiencing  a process that will likely that will be amplified in the future.  Once policies are enacted, measures must also be  monitored over time in order to determine their  effectiveness, because stakeholders need to know whether the policies are fulfilling their intended purposes. This may be challenging initially be- cause the rates of change (millimeters per year of  sea level rise and inches or feet per year of coast- line retreat) are still relatively small, and because  it is difficult to determine whether increased wave heights or larger storms are due to climate change  or just part of the normal range of conditions to  be expected.  It will also be useful for a scientist or other techni- cal person on the Team to keep up with the grow- ing wealth of scientific and technical knowledge that is becoming more and more accessible. Be- yond this, the Team should conduct periodic pro- gram reviews to ensure that neighboring commu- nities are aware of one anothers successes and  failures. Local consultants or university research  groups may also be contracted to conduct regu- lar monitoring of affected planning areas in or- der to assess the effectiveness of the adaptation measures in light of rising sea levels, increasing  wave heights and their associated impacts. From  initiation of the sea level rise adaptation planning  process to its completion, it can be challenging to  keep stakeholders involved and engaged through- out the process, depending upon the team ap- proach used.  In some cases, it may be possible and preferable to  first implement small actions or incremental steps in the most vulnerable or hazard-prone areas that  build support for a larger effort, rather than mak- ing drastic changes immediately. However, for  actions requiring formal adoption by multiple en-Page 39 tities, (e.g., special area management plans), it is  best to treat the process as a major public policy  formulation effort from the very beginning. Finally, it is necessary for a Sea Level Rise Pre- paredness Team to ensure that adaptation mea- sures are appropriate for the geographic area of  its community and its specific issues and that the measures achieve their intended goals. Unfortu- nately, there are many reasons for the failure of  even well-designed and fully implemented mea- sures. Poor execution, overly conservative design  and poor construction can all lead to failure. In or- der to avoid such pitfalls, the Team should engage  an engineer and a geoscientist in the preparation  of standards and formulation of designs while us- ing a performance-based approach to policies and  actions that focuses on outcomes.", "699": "EVALUATING ADAPTATION MEASURES One of the most critical considerations is  whether the actions carried out by imple- mentation of a Sea Level Rise Adaptation Plan  decrease the communitys vulnerability to sea  level rise and its associated impacts as identified in the original Plan. Evaluating progress in terms  of reducing vulnerability will be difficultinitially be- cause the impacts of a rising sea level and increas- ing storm wave climate may take years to become  obvious or recognizable. With a short timeframe,  it is also difficult to determine whether increased wave heights or larger storms are due to climate  change or just part of the normal range of climate  variability. In general, it is prudent to keep track  of any unexpected problems, obstacles or delays  associated with adaptation actions, as well as any  unintended positive or negative consequences. Another important consideration is that sea level  rise preparedness is a long-term and continuous  process. A Team must adjust its original assump- tions as natural, social, economic and political  conditions change. For instance, a Team will likely  come across new scientific information or data that could improve and possibly change its under- standing of its communitys vulnerability to sea  level rise. Science advisors should be consulted in  order to determine whether new findings are rel- evant to the community and its adaptive capacity  and whether they should influence changes in the Adaptation Plan", "700": "I n addition to monitoring and evaluating prog- ress for adaptation measures, the Team should  be able to determine whether its communitys  technical capacity to prepare for sea level rise has  increased. The Team may identify the number of  technical experts in its community (or outside sci- ence advisors) who provide guidance on the latest  information about sea level rise impacts in prior- ity planning areas. It could also track the regular  use of ongoing forums for sharing the latest sea  level rise impact information with key local agen- cy staff, the business community and the general public. In addition, the Team should be able to  show the degree to which sea level rise data is  considered in decisions and preparedness actions  for areas of high vulnerability. The Team can also  determine whether there are sufficient resources (e.g., amount of available funds, etc.) in place for  performing vulnerability and risk assessments, im- plementing preparedness actions and evaluating  progress", "701": "SHARING RESULTS As a Team improves upon its preparedness ac- tions, it should share its results with appropri- ate local government staff, elected officials and the public. Transparency and accountability will  help the Team and the public recognize that im- plementation of the Adaptation Plan achieves its  goals. This will provide the city, county, state, and  federal governments with solid evidence that a  Teams actions deserve funding and political sup- port. In addition, publicizing positive results and  benefits can help to improve community partner- ships, and provide a mechanism for sharing infor- mation on the effectiveness or benefits of the plan with other coastal communities.

For initial explorations, groups can rate sensitivity and adaptive capacity to categorize assets' vulnerability. Sensitivity is the degree to which a population or asset is susceptible or resistant to impacts from weather or climate events.

Examine your full list of actions from the previous step and look for patterns and similarities among the entries. Consider how you might combine actions intended to increase resilience for single asset-threat pairs to protect several assets. Look for an efficient sequence of actions that could reduce risk across the full range of assets.

Recall that the concept of risk encompasses the probability of a loss as well as the magnitude of the loss. Effective actions need to reduce one or both of these elements. Addressing this type of risk is called an expected value analysis. As was the case in earlier steps, some groups choose to engage risk management consultants to assist them with this process. You can decide if each action is a worthwhile investment by comparing the cost to implement it to the expected value of the benefit it will provide. If the total value of reduced risk, increased resilience, and co- benefits are expected to have a comparable or higher value than the cost of implementing the project, expected value is positive. Take a step: Compare the cost to implement each solution you listed to the expected value of the benefit it will provide. Be aware that estimating the potential financial benefit of intangible things such as ecosystem services can lead to a broad range of expected values. Also, in some cases, the expected value of reduced risk associated with an action may seem positive, but only because the action transfers or delays risk. For actions in your plan that do not show a positive expected value, return to Step 4.1 or earlier steps to seek another solution.", "728": "Evaluate trade-offs In light of limited resources, decide what you can do. Compare your list of worthwhile investments with your budget: most groups wont have enough time or money to do everything theyve identified. From your sequence of actions, try to identify a subset of actions you can implement with available resources that would yield a positive benefit-to-cost ratio. Consider that taking action to put an important and highly visible portion of your plan into effect may give you a win that could attract additional resources. As possible, anticipate any unintended consequences that could result from individual actions. Take a step: Decide which positive benefit-to-cost ratio actions you can implement with available resources. If your budget check indicates your feasible solutions wouldnt be sufficient to build resilience, break your actions into smaller steps to identify the most effective solutions you could implement.

Percentage of current land use and zoning plans that have been subject to a  formal consultation process While this metric might not be directly measured by the city, the citys Planning  Department leader would be an appropriate person to provide an informed  estimate, based on legal requirements and government guidelines for consultation  on key city policies and plans. It should be noted within Source and Rationale  field in the online platform that the data provided is based on an estimate and the  name of the person who provided the estimate should also be recorded.", "817": "The inverse of the metric help  respond to the question For some metrics, it may help to think about the inverse of the metric, for which data may be more  readily available. For example: 9.3.1 Internet users (per 100 people)  Data or official estimates may be more readily available for the inverse of this metric, namely the  percentage of the population that cannot access the internet (due to physical or skills barriers)", "818": "The exact timescale required  for the metric may be  extrapolated from other  datasets Data may not be available for the exact timescales stipulated within a metric. In these cases, cities  should try to extrapolate from data calculated over other time periods. For example: 12.4.1. Percentage of buildings [or new development] constructed within the city in the past 10 years  that were approved or otherwise authorised by the relevant city planning authorities Official estimates may be available for the percentage of new development each year that occurs  without authorisation. From this, the percentage of new development without authorisation within  the past 10 years can be extrapolated.

Why is this score achieved? How can the scoring be addressed? Example questions  Performance based: are there indicators with low scores,  unexpectedly low scores, high difference between qualitative  and quantitative scores.   Strategic: are there indicators that are critical to achieving the  citys strategic objectives or governance agenda, critical to the  citys vision or aspirations, of particular interest to key  stakeholders  Prioritised: identify a manageable number - 10-12 indicators  that are significant on the basis of the prioritisation parameter  Combined: identify 3-4 indicators with high performance, and  3-4 indicators with low performance.  Example questions:  Reflection: is the score representative of your  understanding of the city?  Rationale: what is the insight provided by the rationale,  quantitative scores, or data source for the scores? E.G. The  rationale suggests lack of affordability is a key reason for  lower than expected qualitative score or the data source for  the quantitative response does not define the metric in the  same manner.   Aggregation: is the score based on sufficient data or based  on answering adequate number of questions? E.G.  Quantitative score is based on responses to only 1 out of 5  metrics or qualitative score for an indicator is based on  responses from only 1 city stakeholder or average indicator  score is driven by low score on only 1 metric.  Representation: were the right stakeholders included?  Example questions:  Objectives: based on the analysis and knowledge of the  resilience context, what are some key objectives for next  steps? The objective does not necessarily have to relate to  improving performance. Filling data gaps, or engaging  additional stakeholders for data collection can be a valid  objective; e.g. o Not enough metrics were answered to generate the  quantitative score   need to fill data gaps o The qualitative score is based on limited stakeholder  engagement   identify approaches get more perspectives  from larger group of stakeholders  Actions: what actions are needed to achieve these objectives?", "823": "INTERPRETATION STATEMENT Using responses to the guidance questions, look to complete the following analysis statement for each priority  indicator  We have identified _______ as the basis of prioritising indicators. On this basis, indicator _________, with a qualitative score of  _______ and quantitative score of ________ is a priority indicator on account of ______.

Climate change is  already having observable effects on the environment, and past conditions are no longer  a reliable indication of the type or extent of disasters communities will face in the future.  As more and more communities face the effects of natural disasters, decision makers  and community members need tools and guidance to help them take action that can  both protect them from natural disasters while also creating great places to live, work,  and play. This Regional Resilience Toolkit provides:    A coordinated process for meeting many different state and federal planning  requirements.    Communication and outreach guidance and resources for engaging a broad coalition  of stakeholders across a region.    Guidance for project teams who are conducting vulnerability assessments, writing  required plans, and implementing projects.    Clear information and tools that can be used with an advisory group and to bring in  decision makers and community leaders to guide the overall action plan and ensure  its successful implementation.    Detailed appendices with worksheets to help inform and guide work, as well as  additional information and resources for each step.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA), and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission/Association of Bay Area  Governments (MTC/ABAG) have partnered to create this Regional Resilience Toolkit.  These partners used an approach to regional-scale planning and action for disaster resil- ience that was originally developed in the Bay Area. These materials were then used to  help two other regional partners, the City of Mt. Shasta (and neighboring towns) and the  Central Coast Climate Collaborative. EPA and FEMA worked with these two pilot regions Page 4 | Regional Resilience Toolkit Introduction to test how well the materials worked in other geographic, demographic, and political  contexts.  The City of Mt. Shasta and the Central Coast Climate Collaborative both requested assis- tance in building regional resilience. The assistance included a short-term engagement  with one on-site workshop, and each partner region received a next steps memo about  how to implement disaster resilience actions. With the help of regional partners and  participants, the Toolkit has been revised and updated to reflect lessons learned from  these pilots.  One key lesson from the two pilots was that state-level policies can really spur along local  and regional resilience action because jurisdictions are given new tools, guidance, and  even funding support to plan for natural hazards. For example, the California legislature  has passed a series of bills that create incentives and requirements for local governments  to consider natural hazards and environmental justice and equity as part of routine plan  updates. See Figure 26 for more details on these policies. However, any jurisdiction in any  state can still use existing plans and processes to improve community safety, livability,  and long-term resilience. The Toolkit is intended for any jurisdiction, no matter the size or capacity or hazards they  may face now or in the future. The Toolkit is set up to allow multiple jurisdictions and  levels of government to work together for regional scale actions. It is also designed for  non-governmental partners and community groups to engage in a more inclusive and  holistic process so that resilience actions are guided by core community values. This Toolkit and its steps are designed to fulfill requirements for Local Hazard Mitigation  Plan (LHMP) approval and update, and closely follows FEMAs Local Mitigation Planning  Handbook1. Rather than solely identifying community assets, this process encourages a  more in-depth approach to conducting a vulnerability assessment and selecting hazard  mitigation actions. This is intended to help shape each assessment according to a  communitys preferred goals for a more locally meaningful and actionable LHMP.", "873": "Resilience is about building the capacity of the community, at various scales, to prepare  for, withstand, recover, and maintain its identity in the face of actual or anticipated  hazard occurrences, allowing for continuity of community and quick recovery if a disaster  occurs", "874": "  An understanding of why trust is so important, and how to build it   Tools for effective storytelling   A Stakeholder Map that includes your project team, advisory group, leadership and  decision makers, interest groups, and the broader community   An Engagement and Outreach Plan that identifies goals, target audiences, key  messages, tools for outreach, strategies for outreach, and an implementation plan", "875": "  An understanding of why trust is so important, and how to build it   Tools for effective storytelling   A Stakeholder Map that includes your project team, advisory group, leadership and  decision makers, interest groups, and the broader community   An Engagement and Outreach Plan that identifies goals, target audiences, key  messages, tools for outreach, strategies for outreach, and an implementation plan", "876": "  An understanding of why trust is so important, and how to build it   Tools for effective storytelling   A Stakeholder Map that includes your project team, advisory group, leadership and  decision makers, interest groups, and the broader community   An Engagement and Outreach Plan that identifies goals, target audiences, key  messages, tools for outreach, strategies for outreach, and an implementation plan", "877": "STEP 2.

Who?  The first step is to inventory and identify stakeholders who should be involved,  including the broader public and groups who are often underrepresented and hard to  reach. Engage a broad range of stakeholders with the necessary expertise, values, and  viewpoints at each stage of assessment and implementation.  What? The lead agency will need to identify what each stakeholder or stakeholder groups role is  in the resilience building process, in implementing strategies, and within the community.  When (or how often)? For the identified stakeholders, determine the level of input and outreach that is appro- priate and necessary based on their desired level of engagement and planning role. Align  stakeholder expectations with the planning requirements and required level of outreach  budget and resources available. How? The next step is to determine the best approaches to engaging and reaching the stake- holders. Certain processes, and certain stakeholders may prefer a traditional formal  outreach approach while others prefer digital tools, videos, short interactions, or other  mechanisms.

Each community is different,  but often non-English speakers, disadvantaged communities, Native Americans/tribal  communities, the homeless, and other groups can be left out of or choose not to partic- ipate in planning efforts.

Leverage existing  partner meetings and processes as a means to introduce the project. For community  members, this can mean going to a farmers market, holiday event, health fair, school,  church event, or setting up shop in a local caf or brewery. For more technical stake- holders it can mean attending another organizations staff meeting or partnering on a  relevant but separate planning effort.  Identify what we love and what we want to protect. Begin a dialogue in a  community workshop, survey, or small group setting by asking what people love and  what they want to protect.  Move beyond the workshop. What are the communitys specific preferences for  engagement and sustained interactions? Traditional meetings and workshops are too  often a one-way communication from professional staff to residents and do not lead  to the type of interactive, dynamic dialog that is crucial to a plan that will be broadly  supported by different stakeholders.", "889": "Conduct stakeholder interviews. Connect with the formal and informal leaders, partner  organizations, and community members through informational and discovery interviews.  Interviews are excellent mechanisms to better discuss and understand underlying issues  or concerns in a discrete way and can be an effective means to engage people who may  be advocates or adversaries.  Launch immersive listening sessions with diverse stakeholder groups. Conduct small  group meetings with invited stakeholders, arranged around a topic or cohort group (e.g.,  schools, businesses, environmental groups, etc.) to uncover issues and opportunities.", "890": "Tell the Story If you need someone to back your innovation, invest in your idea, or get excited about  following your lead, you need to tell a great story. - IDEO, Storytelling for Influence While listening is a substantial part of successfully engaging stakeholders, it is equally  critical to ensure that project teams and other project representatives are communicating  the right information, at the right time, to the right people. One of the most successful  approaches is telling a story. Project teams can use stories as a frame for communication,  to orient and design project information for the specific audience, and help move the  audience to action by connecting on a more personal level. Figure 15 illustrates four vital  elements for a range of communication channels (e.g., press conference, funding pitch,  workshop, or one-on-one meeting, etc.).  ", "891": "Best Practices to Tell a Story Grab attention: Get peoples attention and help them to recognize the point of the  communication. Grabbing peoples attention is essential  through a remarkable fact,  a surprising comparison, or a visual. Tie it to the point of the story within the first 30  seconds. For example, a good start might be, My uncles home burned down in the  2017 Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County, California. Not only were his home and personal life  impacted, whole neighborhoods and communities were destroyed.  This offers a signif- icant fact that is attention grabbing and then quickly connects it to action. Engage and relate to audience: Directly relate the story to the audience and what  resonates with them so that the listener becomes engaged and interested. To be  effective, use specific information about the community, organization, or person.  Continuing the example above, one could say, Our local fire department helped to fight  in that fire and many of you in this room lost properties in these historic fires. Core story: Develop the meat of the story with core elements, details, and facts. Organize  the core story into succinct pieces  three is a manageable number  with clear connec- tions to the storys point and to help hint at what the call to action might be. The example  might continue, The Tubbs Fire wasnt unique. In 2017 alone, California experienced  9,133 fires that burned over 1.3 million acres. And we can expect to see more of the same  in the years ahead.", "892": "Call to action: Tie the entire story together with a strong call to action. This is perhaps  the most important step. Reiterate the key point and connect it to what the ask is. An  ask can be for funding, for a meeting, for support, or for an opportunity to follow up.  The call to action not only provides a take away for the audience but also provides an  opening to re-engage and to follow up on the ask. Finally, the example story would  wrap up with, As a community, we need to band together to be better prepared, protect  people, and reduce the potential damage to our town.", "893": "Stakeholder Mapping Stakeholder mapping is the process of understanding perspectives and interests,  visualizing relationships, and establishing which stakeholders are the highest priority  for engagement. It may quickly become evident that many people could and should  be involved in the planning effort. However, it is essential to differentiate the various  audiences based on their level of interest and engagement, what level of technical under- standing and input they have, and what level of resources are available to reach and  engage the various groups.  The following are examples of criteria to consider in identifying technical and community  audiences:    The stakeholder owns an important asset.   The stakeholder has the authority to regulate, make policy, or make decisions about  an asset or asset class.   The stakeholder will be affected by the assessment or potential strategies.   The stakeholder has the potential to either help or hinder the political process.    The stakeholder has specialized expertise that will help with technical questions.   The stakeholder may be able to provide funding or otherwise assist in implementing  strategies.   The stakeholder represents typically underrepresented community members.   The stakeholder may be able to make critical connections to other relevant topic  areas and/or projects which the project team is unaware.    The stakeholder has the time and ability to commit time and effort to the project.", "894": "Map partners to identify trusted and influential actors.  Key partners may include a city council aide, faith groups, community organizations,  skeptics, and social media influencers, among others; the lead agency will need to create  a baseline and evolving set(s) of partners to engage in specific ways. Creating a map of  all of the potential players is a good start to creating a stakeholder engagement strategy.  Use a diagram similar to Figure 18 to identify those with the highest level of influence,  and those with the greatest interest to ensure that the effort is reaching the right people  at the right level. This type of diagram can also be used to identify where there are stake- holders who have a low influence and interest (lower left quadrant), but there is a benefit  to better engaging them and moving them to be more involved.", "895": "Sample Outline for an Engagement  and Outreach Plan 1.

The objective of the assessment is to determine where hazards and community assets  intersect and to determine what the potential impacts are at that intersection - or what is  the assets vulnerability and risk to hazards. In the assessment, make sure to consider:   Does asset vulnerability include impacts to people (especially disadvantaged commu- nities), to the economy, and to the environment?   Do seemingly unimportant assets provide support to a critical asset?   Who controls the asset and how does that affect mitigation efforts?   Are there physical or design attributes that make an asset particularly vulnerable,  such as age of the building?", "900": "Scope and Organize the Project Establish the scope of the project and a develop a common understanding about the  purpose and need for the assessment.

Is it an individual, or a regulation, or general  pressure from the community, an agency, or neighboring jurisdictions?   Who cares about this process and why? What are the motivations behind who cares  and why they care?   What is the lens through which the team is viewing this process? Is this rooted in  climate change, sustainability, equity, etc.? Are there multiple lenses?   How should the team measure a successful process?    Is this project a stand alone project or will there be multiple small assessments with  different stakeholders as part of a larger project?   How can this effort tie to the other planning efforts and amplify potential outcomes? The answers to these questions can help identify and focus the scope of the project,  including determining the geographical area, priorities and draft goals that will help  shape the extent of the project, and desired outcomes. It is also quite useful to review all  previous hazard plans and technical studies (such as for flood areas) to know what infor- mation has been assembled previously.", "904": "Identify Triggers and Lenses, and Coordinate  with Other Plans Everyone who picks up this document will have their own trigger for moving through  this process. A trigger is something that spurs this work to happen; this could be an  external trigger like a regulatory requirement or an internal trigger such as a strong  champion. The trigger provides the motivation to do resilience building work. The Toolkit  was developed primarily to help communities that are triggered by the LHMP process,  but users will be able to apply this process to any risk and vulnerability assessment, no  matter the trigger. Below are some of the most common triggers for undergoing a risk  and vulnerability assessment. Recent disaster. Sometimes resilience building is triggered by either a local disaster or  a high profile disaster elsewhere, that wakes up jurisdictions and causes them to realize  that they must take action to reduce the risk.  Regulatory landscape. The entry point to resilience building may be triggered by regula- tions, which include specific requirements about what the assessment should include.  (See Figure 26 for an example of regulatory triggers in California.) Local or national trends. A high visibility local, state, or national thought leader can help  trigger others to conduct resilience planning. This can be especially true when it comes to  climate adaptation, as there is a general understanding of the regional nature of sea level  rise and other climate hazards. Business and investment. A visible, public process to assess the communitys risks and  to be responsive to them is a clear signal to the business and insurance community of the  citys commitment to long-term resilience and viability.  ", "905": "Establish Resilience Goals Developing effective resilience goals is an important step to establish a common  foundation for stakeholders, the project team, and decision makers. Goals also offer a  touchstone throughout the project to assess if strategies and implementation priorities  align with the communitys needs and desires. Establishing common resilience goals  assist in:    Building transparency into the process at the outset so that all participants under- stand the breadth of priorities and topics to cover.    Engaging the project team early in deciding what shared outcomes they will work  cooperatively to achieve and provide an opportunity for them to ask their stake- holders for input and feedback on the project direction.    Providing a foundation upon which future project decisions can be made and help in  evaluating how well mitigation actions will help meet established community values  and expectations.   Connecting to metrics and aid in tracking and monitoring progress of the  project through implementation. Leveraging existing community goals, such as those in a local compre- hensive plan, can help ensure alignment, and can rally a broader base of  support amongst stakeholders who have already bought into existing  goals or priorities. Further, linking existing goals to resilience goals  can provide additional impetus and support to advance broad  community goals.", "906": "Setting Resilience Goals Goals may be driven by a desire to protect:   Physical areas (e.g., new development along the shoreline, natural resource areas  or assets)   Asset classes (e.g., critical services)   Social values (e.g., protecting parks because beauty and recreation are highly  held values)   Economic values (e.g., protecting major economic drivers like large businesses)   Character, history, sense of place (e.g., protecting historic structures  or neighborhoods)   Existing functions/activities (e.g., preserving the function of an airport or seaport)   Specific communities (e.g., vulnerable populations) Use the following questions to help refine broad goals.   Does everyone understand the goal? Is it written in clear language? Are there multiple  ways to interpret the goal?    Who is responsible for implementation? Does the lead agency have influence or  ability to achieve the goal? Are the resources, skill, and knowledge available to achieve  the goal?   How does the team know when a goal has been achieved? Is there a milestone that  has been reached? An amount of money spent? An action achieved?   Can the jurisdictions involved realistically achieve that goal? If not, what is more likely?    Is it clear what the result or outcome is from achieving the goal?   When should the goal be achieved? Is there a specific date or timeframe that can be  established as a target? Should there be a mid-term timeframe?", "907": "Identify and Map Hazards Before conducting a risk and vulnerability assessment, identify and describe the hazards  that are or may be present within the community. An important part of this step is identi- fying which hazards pose the greatest threat to the community. You can qualitatively  estimate which hazards will have the most impact by considering the extent of exposure  (this can be measured by the number of people exposed, number of buildings exposed,  or the value of assets exposed), the consequences of a hazard, and the likelihood of the  hazard occurring.    Discuss the types of hazards to be considered - natural hazards (e.g. wildfires, earth- quakes), man-made hazards (e.g. cyber attacks, terrorism).    Review maps and information of hazards predicting and depicting current and future  flooding, wildfire risk areas, landslide risk areas, or earthquake ground shaking or  liquefaction risk, etc.    Understand past hazard patterns. Where have they struck and how often?   Talk to emergency managers as well as operations and maintenance staff who will  have knowledge of areas most frequently affected.   Identify the hazards most likely to impact the community.   Identify changes that may intensify or increase the possibility of hazards.   Use climate change data to anticipate how hazards may change in the future,  including the intensity and frequency of hazards, as well as how the community will  be impacted by new and unfamiliar hazards.", "908": "Develop Hazard Impact Statements Develop written descriptions that describe the extent, probability, and expected severity  of the hazard. This can help succinctly summarize hot spots or areas with multiple  hazards that should receive special attention in assessment or strategy development.  These descriptions are often called hazard impact statements. As an example, a hazard statement might read: The western portion of the city has  very high liquefaction susceptibility while the remainder of the city has a low likelihood  of liquefaction. Liquefaction may occur in earthquakes with very high levels of shaking,  including one from the Hayward fault, which runs adjacent to the city and has a high  probability of occurring in the next thirty years.  ", "909": "Prioritize Hazards To complete the risk assessment, prioritize the hazards that could have the most impact  on the community. This will help determine which assets will need the most robust  assessment (based on exposure to prioritized hazards), can help understand the overlap  between high priority hazards and vulnerable populations, or can help engage certain  stakeholders.  Once the hazards are prioritized it is a good time for the project team to consider if  it is necessary to refine or reprioritize the goals previously outlined. In addition, now  that it is understood where hazards may affect the community use that information to  guide the remainder of the risk assessment, including which assets should be considered  and what information needs to be gathered.", "910": "Select Assets Hazards become meaningful when they interact with assets. Community assets  include the people, structures, facilities, and infrastructure systems that have value to  the community. (e.g., a tsunami only poses a risk when it lands in an area with bridges,  homes, and wastewater facilities.) Some questions to consider when determining  community assets:   What are the places and elements that the community loves?   Which assets are critical to maintaining safety, health, and productivity in the  community?   Are there unique or critical facilities that the community relies upon?   Which assets would have significant consequences to the community if they failed?   How much information is available on each asset to guide your assessment?

Assets can be grouped  and assessed in three ways, which will influence the level of detail and effort required for  the assessment:  Individual asset: A unique or critically important asset for which assessment findings  would differ from other assets. For example, a power plant or major thoroughfare may  be individual assets. Representative asset: Assessment findings would be similar across a group of similar  assets and would streamline the assessment process. For example, elementary schools  may have very similar vulnerabilities across a jurisdiction. So instead of assessing each  site, the assessment can be for the cross-section to reveal potential vulnerabilities  inherent in all schools. Individual assets might have issues specific to their location  for  ", "913": "example, one elementary school might be near a flood plain while another might have  only one road leading to it. Those issues should be considered when necessary. Asset class: An asset class is a categorization of similar assets in one group. Figure 31  shows five classes: community and people; critical services; built environment; economy;  and natural environment. Categorizing a class of assets allows jurisdictions to develop  goals and strategies that may address the broad grouping. For instance, for community  and people, a goal could be zero loss of life in disaster.", "914": "Determine Assessment Method The depth and scope of a vulnerability assessment can vary significantly and will depend  on community goals, the availability of data and information, resources to conduct the  assessment, and individual interests of the jurisdiction and its residents. Looking at  other vulnerability assessments is a good first step for establishing base informational  requirements. The simplest assessment includes an exposure analysis, which maps hazards on top of  locations of key assets to identify a potential hazard. This approach requires at least a list  of key assets, their locations, and an overlay map of hazards located in the assessment  area. More information about an assets vulnerability can transform an assessment into a  compelling story that sets up targeted, meaningful actions.  However, more detailed information on assets can help uncover the vulnerabilities  and consequences for key assets and provides a better platform for identifying hazard  mitigation and climate adaptation strategies to address hazards. Because it is important  to understand what will happen to assets and the people and services that rely on them  if they are exposed to a hazard, the project team may want to go beyond the exposure  analysis and collect vulnerability information on the assets. This can be achieved through  answering a series of assessment questions about the asset.   At a minimum, assess emergency response facilities and critical public facilities related  to essential services such as police, fire, water, and power.   A more comprehensive assessment may include residential units, infrastructure  systems, and/or recreational spaces.   The most comprehensive approach would be to evaluate all assets individually, but  this will likely require more resources. Project teams may take a simplified approach  by choosing a representative asset to assess that may be similar to many others,  house important services, or serve a large number of residents. If assessing a repre- sentative asset is not possible, asset classes can be assessed with far fewer resources,  but can still provide information useful for the community.", "915": "Exposure Analysis An exposure analysis is a deeper dive within the larger risk and vulnerability assessment  to focus in on specific impacts to selected assets. It helps identify which assets will be  exposed to a specific hazard and provides a basic understanding of the magnitude  of possible damage or loss after a disaster. For example, an exposure analysis can  determine how many housing units are likely to be exposed to an earthquake and  provide a high level estimate of the economic effects. An exposure analysis involves combining the location and extent of the hazards  with the location of assets. This is generally done through Geographic Information  System (GIS) mapping using pre-identified hazard scenario map layers and mapped  community asset locations. There are five key steps to the exposure analysis (See  Appendix A for more details): 1. Add relevant hazard layers into a new or existing map in ARCGIS (or similar tool). 2. Gather data and map the locations of the community assets included in the  assessment scope. 3. Compare assets to the hazard layers. 4. Create maps showing the extent of hazards and the location of assets that intersect  with those hazards. (See Figure 33) 5. Ask those with local knowledge and experience to help pinpoint locations that are not  accurate and need further analysis.", "916": "Add relevant hazard layers into a new or existing map in ARCGIS (or similar tool).", "917": "Answer Assessment Questions Assessment questions help describe the existing conditions, different types of vulnerabil- ities, and consequences that may occur if an individual or representative asset is exposed  to a specific hazard. There are separate assessment questions for individual or repre- sentative assets and asset classes, so be sure to use the correct assessment questions  worksheet for the appropriate scale.  Assessment questions include describing and determining the following information:   Ownership and characteristics of an asset   Existing conditions    Physical vulnerabilities to hazards   Functional vulnerabilities including dependencies or relationships to other assets    Governance vulnerabilities   Consequences if asset is damaged or destroyed", "918": "Develop Profile Sheets Describe the asset or asset class. Describe the key functions of the asset or asset class,  the geographic extent of it, who it serves, and any other relevant information. Describe key issues. Identify pressing issues such as vulnerable populations that may  be affected, very high risk areas, or significant financial consequences.  Describe the vulnerabilities. List all of the vulnerabilities uncovered. There are a few  basic categories that can help organize vulnerability types:   Information. Poor data/information can hinder understanding of vulnerability and  risk, or can affect the ability to achieve mitigation or adaptation strategies.   Governance. Identify characteristics such as inadequate authority or regulatory  mechanisms, inadequate or unavailable sources of funding, or lack of mechanisms  to address issues affecting multiple sectors, jurisdictions, or communities.    Functions. Identify functions, roles, or relationships that make assets especially  vulnerable. For example, a senior facility may be more vulnerable than an  office building because of its function and the dependence on outside services.  Functional vulnerabilities could include lack of system redundancy, dependence  on vulnerable assets, the function of the asset itself, or the assets position in a  networked system.   Physical. Physical vulnerabilities that make an asset acutely sensitive or limit its  ability to withstand hazards. This could include water sensitivity or buildings that  are built to older codes that are known to perform poorly in disasters. Describe the short-, mid- and long-term consequences. Summarize the effects that  vulnerabilities could have on people, the economy, and the environment.    People. Describe the effects on people where they live, work, recreate, obtain key  services, and conduct other day-to-day activities. Consider vulnerable populations.   Environment. Describe the effects on the environment, such as damage to  wetlands from sea level rise or potential hazardous materials release.   Economy. Describe the effects on important elements of the regional economy,  such as impacts to goods and movement of people, employment centers, and  business sectors. ", "919": "Summarize Vulnerability After completing the risk assessment, summarize the findings to identify the most  significant risks in the community. These findings or problem statements will help to  craft effective strategies and actions. Problem statements will help to:   Communicate critical planning issues, for example which critical assets are particu- larly vulnerable, what areas currently have repetitive losses, or how many high hazard  areas are currently zoned for future development.   Assist the community and stakeholders to prioritize and focus on the areas that have  the greatest need for mitigation or adaptation based on the risk assessment.    Create a clear and cogent story to help support decision making by elected officials  and other stakeholders.   Provide a foundation for seeking funds to reduce risks and increase community  resilience.", "920": "The first step in writing problem statements is to review the exposure analysis maps and  answers to the assessment questions. It is often the case that a number of assets will  have similar characteristics, conditions and challenges, so it makes sense to read through  and reflect on all of the answers before beginning to summarize. The second step is to use the answers to the assessment questions to write summary  statements describing the vulnerabilities and consequences identified. Depending on the  process, the statements can summarize the assessment findings for individual assets,  a particular asset category or services, the community as a whole, or the agencies and  organizations that own, operate, or manage the assets evaluated. When writing problem statements, consider what vulnerabilities or consequences to  include, and if a stand alone problem statement is most effective. Some vulnerabilities  will rise to immediate or near-term need, such as those that have:   Broad or wide ranging effects on society and equity, including to a large geographic  area, large numbers of residents, or to environmental justice communities.   Reduce ecosystem benefits provided by natural areas, such as flood risk reduction,  water quality improvement, and supporting biodiversity.   Economic impacts at multiple scales, including local, regional, statewide and national.   Urgency and complexity, which requires a longer timeframe to address. For example,  there may be a stretch of shoreline that may flood with small amounts of sea level  rise, but will take a long time to solve due to complexities in ownership, management,  financing, and regulatory oversight.   Cascading effects on other assets, services, or communities. This is particularly an  issue for networked assets, such as transportation, utilities, and shoreline protection,  which are interconnected in a manner such that failure of one part of the system will  disrupt the rest of the system. This will also be an issue for assets that rely on other  assets to maintain functionality, for example hospitals, nursing homes, and waste- water treatment plants that rely on uninterrupted power supplied by others.", "921": "Develop Strategies Once the vulnerability assessment is complete, develop strategies and specific actions  and projects to address the vulnerabilities. It is important to ensure that the strategies  are actionable, feasible, flexible, and that they are built on the communitys long-term  vision and values, and link to the plans goals (see figure below). Consider these best  practices in developing strategies:   Link strategies directly to problem statements: strategies offer the solutions to the  problems identified in the risk assessment.    Select fewer, more actionable strategies rather than a long laundry list of potential  actions.    Address multiple problems or vulnerabilities with a single strategy.   Ensure that there is someone who can be the lead on a strategy - someone who has  the authority, political will, ability, time, and resources to make it happen.    Directly align strategies with resilience goals outlined at the beginning of the process.", "922": "Develop Initial List of Strategies This step focuses on developing an initial list of potential strategies that are responsive  to specific problem statements.

Carefully considered evaluation criteria can provide a tool  for prioritization. Evaluation criteria can be an essential tool to gauge the priorities and  values of different agencies, organizations, communities, or other stakeholders to ensure  that strategies are well balanced to reflect the communitys goals. Evaluation criteria  can also reveal new perspectives in how different strategies impact the four frames   society and equity, economy, environment, and governance  or whatever frames the  community has identified. Evaluating strategies through these frames can identify and  highlight the benefits and tradeoffs of strategies in each frame, which can be very useful  when garnering political, community, and financial support for implementation.  The four frames can reveal some of the following characteristics of each strategy:   Society and equity: Effects on communities and the services on which they rely, with  specific attention to disproportionate impacts due to social, political, or economic  inequality.   Economy: Economic aspects that may be affected such as costs of physical infra- structure damages or lost revenues during recovery periods.   Environment: Environmental aspects that may be affected, including ecosystem  functions and services and species diversity.   Governance: Factors such as organizational structure, ownership of assets,  management responsibilities of assets, jurisdictional mandates, regulations, or  funding options that affect how a community can respond to a hazard. The evaluation criteria can be used not just by the project team, but by any individual or  group that will play a significant role in implementation. Vetting and evaluating strategies  are a key piece of community outreach to ensure that the plan for building resilience  represents what the community wants and needs for a safer future.

An easy win is a strategy that is easy to achieve and provides a  high level of benefit.   Is it an unlocking strategy? For example, are additional studies required or new  stakeholders needed before the city can implement a priority strategy?   Is the timing right? For instance, if the regular building code update is due in the  next year, it may make sense to prioritize a strategy to update the building code  to take climate change projections into account within that same process and  time frame.

Below are some best  practices to use as the project team develops implementation plans.    Connect implementation to the goals and process completed to get to this point.    Understand the needs and wants of stakeholders and community members.    Use survey and polling to gauge broad support for plans and actions.

A Long-Term Implementation Plan (5-20 years) is typically higher level, and used to  share with stakeholders and decision makers, is included in formal plan documents, and  illustrates how to achieve the vision and plan goals.  A Short-Term Action Plan (0-5 years) can act as a staff level working plan that details  each step or tactic necessary to achieve those longer term goals and vision in a more  manageable time frame, up to 2 years.

Many partners can get  behind a concept, but when it comes to dedicating funding, time, or resources, it can  be a challenge. The process identified in this Toolkit is designed to help avoid common  pitfalls, particularly inadequate engagement of stakeholders, decision-makers and the  community. The following are some best practices to adhere to when developing imple- mentation plans: 1. Political buy in. Elected officials, like council members, have the power to expedite or  stymie action. Building a supportive political climate and addressing the concerns of  elected officials or other decision makers can make the difference between action and  inaction.  2. Sustained commitment. Many actions can take years to implement. Projects may  span multiple terms of office for elected officials and multiple funding cycles. It helps  to have an advocate at a high level (see above point about political buy-in), but beyond  elected officials, who may cycle in and out of office before a project is complete,  engagement of department heads, city administrators, city managers, or someone  similar helps ensure implementation success.  3. Focus actions where the money is. Varying priorities from funders means that  sources of funding may not align with all actions identified and prioritized. Rather than  focusing on an action without regard to where funding will be coming from, select  actions that align with funding priorities. (See Step 4. FUND for more on this)  4. Piggyback on successful local projects. What kinds of projects are already successful  in communities? Every community has its own capital spending pattern, which reveals  the priorities of the community. These priorities should have been identified early on  in the project, and strategies and actions should align with existing community prior- ities. It is important to look at existing projects to see where resilience actions may be  able to piggyback.  5. Use existing processes, groups, or sources of funding. Similar to capitalizing on  existing successful projects, consider how existing working groups, departments,  or funding streams can be adapted to include actions that advance resilience. For  example, if a community already has a sustainability council that brings together  cross-agency staff or department heads, that group could expand its mission  to advance resilience as well. Additionally, current investments in infrastructure  Example: Linking Climate Adaptation  and Hazard Mitigation  in Massachusetts In 2018, the state of Massachusetts completed an  integrated State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation  Plan. The plan outlines 108 specific actions that meet the  requirements both for federal disaster mitigation funds  and for the governors executive order requiring the state  to prepare for the impacts of climate change. These 108 actions are scored by priority and have detailed  information about the lead agency, partners, funding  sources, and completion time frame. Key state agencies  will track progress of each action and update and develop  new actions over time.  www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-integrated- state-hazard-mitigation-and-climate-adaptation-plan  (Chapters 7 and 8) Regional Resilience Toolkit | Page 67  Step 3. ACT maintenance may be able to be adapted to incorporate protective actions like water- proofing or seismic retrofit to improve the longevity of infrastructure without the need  for new bond measures or other sources of funding. 6. Consider the citys partners. Many resilience projects are complex, with multiple  owners, regulators, or users of assets that need retrofit, moving, or rebuilding. Create  more realistic solutions by identifying and engaging with all involved stakeholders  from the beginning, and taking into account all of the moving pieces involved in imple- menting a solution.  7. Do not be afraid to build something new. Sometimes it makes more of a statement  and political splash to create an entirely new effort, especially if the effort can garner  a lot of excitement and involvement from a wide variety of stakeholders. For example,  Bay Conservation and Development Commissions 2009 Rising Tides design compe- tition generated region-wide interest in climate adaptation, leading to the devel- opment of the Adapting to Rising Tides Program, which has worked with many cities  and counties since the competition to develop in-depth vulnerability assessments and  sea level rise adaptation strategies for the region.  Every community will need its approach for implementing resilience building actions,  building on existing processes to create adaptive decision making and action taking.  Ensuring successful implementation stems from active engagement of stakeholders,  coordinated decision making, and wide ranging capacity building to minimize barriers to  action and garner meaningful support", "937": "Figuring out how to fund a project or resilience initiative is a difficult challenge to solve  for almost all jurisdictions.

The concept, similar to a capital stack, is based on the understanding that there is an  inherently correct sequence of funding and financing to maximize investments. To  establish an effective capital strategy, the project team must be intentional about its  funding and financing approach from the beginning, and structure its engagement,  project development, communications, and resources in a way to leverage and enhance  the potential to establish a robust and diverse capital strategy. Most cities struggle to  find start-up investments that will bring more partners to the table to scope the project  and lay the groundwork, whether through initial design, property acquisition, permitting,  and other early-stage project phases. Yet these start-up funds are critical to leverage  long-term recovery and pre-disaster funding. Certain investments, such as those from a community foundation or general fund, can be  made early in the process as they require limited return on that investment and are able  to seed additional funding sources, particularly private investments, that need a stronger  foundation and low-risk profile. For resilience projects, particularly large infrastructure  projects, building this funding foundation is essential. Resilience financial planning  must consider the need to secure early, pre-development funds from local government  reserves or budgets, private-sector partners, or philanthropy sources. This leverages  available government funding and keeps initiatives on track.  Communities must consider the overall timing and complicated fiscal process for  bringing disaster resilience projects to fruition. Project teams will need to pinpoint  financial milestones and appropriate funding sequences to implement the project. This  sequencing is tricky to manage, because external government grants are frequently  allocated for projects that are fully planned and designed. An effective resilience capital  strategy often starts with local, self-reliant investments, and leverages those monies with  public-private partnerships, philanthropic dollars, regional funds, grants, and private- sector investments.", "951": "Self-Reliant Resilience Financing Starting with the inventory of local resources demonstrates community commitment to a  more self-reliant financial future. It also provides local matching funds required for many  federal grant programs and shows private investors that local jurisdictions are serious  about addressing risks and willing to adopt innovative ways to fund community safety.  Use the following common (and not-so-common) tools for local resilience financing.  ", "952": "Develop an initial financial strategy that starts with locally-based funding opportu- nities. The strategy should consider the following elements:  Embed resilience budgeting into the communitys fiscal planning. As resilience funding  is often limited to external, limited scope grants or restricted portions of general fund  or capital improvement plan budgets, local resources are undervalued. This includes  existing budget planning as part of mainstream operations. Incrementally, resilience  projects and initiatives need to be part of the regular budget and decision-making  discussions.  Examine all funding sources at hand as possible resilience monies that can open  new possibilities to implement projects more quickly. Comb through internal budget  sources and consider how to re-purpose existing funds or create new revenue  scenarios to leverage whats already available.  Influence community-wide conversation and day-to-day decisions about long-term  capital improvements to both inform the public and build support for future funding  campaigns. Every community has an investment approach shaped by local values, identified risks,  and consensus solutions resulting from local dialogue. Developing a zero-based local  budget analysis to closely examine resources at hand can be the gateway to advance a  diverse resilience funding strategy. Start by looking at existing internal processes, groups,  or sources of funding as topics for public consideration that could offer unexpected  answers on how to mainstream resilience projects. Local jurisdictions or regional  agencies with cross-functional project groups or inter-departmental work teams may  be able to incorporate resilience components into ongoing capital projects or planning  initiatives. Projects already poised to be funded and implemented are prime examples  of efforts to review as potential vehicles for readily integrating resilience improvements. ", "953": "dapting current asset management budgets for infrastructure maintenance might  easily combine protective actions such as weather-proofing or structural improvements  to expand the full lifecycle investment and infrastructure upgrade with little or no extra  funding. This approach is successful when done with a robust participatory process to  balance the perspectives of government and local residents. Once local resources are  scrutinized and realistically assessed as untapped funds for resilience projects, decision  makers can identify additional resilience funding gaps and plan for outside grants or  loans. See Worksheet 4.2 Local Funding Source Inventory Worksheet. It is possible, at the local and state levels, to provide fiscal and resource incentives for  resilience improvements that property owners use to good purpose. Some disaster- experienced communities have funded post-event grants (some funded through FEMA  or the state Office of Emergency Services) for homeowners to use to implement fire and  seismic safety improvements. Other cities have provided permit fee waivers, expedited  approvals and property transfer tax rebates for residential resilience upgrades. New  programs in residential energy and water efficiency offer a promising pathway for  property owners to include disaster safety improvements to their renovation projects.  It is also possible to leverage these sustainability resources with added state and public  utility federal incentives. The following list describes some of the local or regional  financing options that can be used to support resilience projects:.  Existing budgets. Assess for potential resilience funding or to leverage financing  opportunities, including utility user fees, special service taxes, existing general  obligation bond monies, and other operational funds.  Existing infrastructure and community development funds. Review water, public  safety, energy efficiency, retrofit funding, green infrastructure funds, housing, climate  action, and transportation program budgets. Determine how these monies can be  unlocked and combined with other funds to amplify resilience action investments  and achieve supplemental improvements, e.g., improving a buildings energy efficiency  while retrofitting for earthquake resilience.  Bonds. Local jurisdictions can issue municipal and general obligation bonds with voter  approval for taxes assessed on property parcels. Bond proceeds can fund capital  improvements. Other types of bonds include social impact, green, resilience, and  environmental impact bonds.", "954": " Special tax assessment districts.

Programs such as the Department of Treasurys  Opportunity Zone program attract funders to public sector infrastructure investments by  providing investment tax incentives if private sector partners remain for ten years in the  resilience venture. The underused private sector investment is a promising opportunity  that communities are exploring as public sector finance programs shift eligibility require- ments, reduce grant allocations or simply discontinue operations. Private sector finance may provide funds from instruments including insurance-linked  securities, obtained through insurance policies that cover disaster-related impacts, and  catastrophe bonds that pay premiums after a specific, pre-designated disaster hits the  policy-holder jurisdiction. Social and environmental impact and green bonds are issued  by local governments, for environmental and infrastructure improvements, and provide  tax benefits for the municipality. For example, the Port of Los Angeles issued $35.2  million in green bonds in 2015 for port infrastructure improvements; the City of Los  Angeles has used green bonds to improve municipal water systems. The first set of Opportunity Zones were designated in April 2018, and now all 50 states,  the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories have designated Opportunity Zones.  The program will allow for long-term investments in housing, infrastructure systems,  commercial and economic development in state-designated, frontline communities.  These investments offer a potentially powerful new tool to speed resilience imple- mentation with private investor funds.

The underused private sector investment is a promising opportunity  that communities are exploring as public sector finance programs shift eligibility require- ments, reduce grant allocations or simply discontinue operations. Private sector finance may provide funds from instruments including insurance-linked  securities, obtained through insurance policies that cover disaster-related impacts, and  catastrophe bonds that pay premiums after a specific, pre-designated disaster hits the  policy-holder jurisdiction. Social and environmental impact and green bonds are issued  by local governments, for environmental and infrastructure improvements, and provide  tax benefits for the municipality. For example, the Port of Los Angeles issued $35.2  million in green bonds in 2015 for port infrastructure improvements; the City of Los  Angeles has used green bonds to improve municipal water systems.

Tracking success and evaluating actions are critical elements in ensuring effective imple- mentation of resilience strategies and projects, meeting local needs, securing sound  investments, and ensuring people work together effectively. Identifying what to measure  (metrics), and how to track and evaluate those metrics over time is central to quantifying  results. Good metrics provide:    A baseline that indicates the starting point;    A target for where the community is going;   An indication if there is something wrong; and    Highlights when the agency or city achieves its goal.  Further, well designed metrics can help tell a story for why resilience building is  necessary, attract political support and funding, and focus efforts while providing a  feedback mechanism about whether decisions, investments, and actions to improve resil- ience are making a difference and can help guide future decisions. Good metrics should  be designed to do the following:    Connect to goals, community values, and desired outcomes.    Feasibly track information required to measure the metric. If the data is too difficult or  expensive to track and gather, it does not help.    Mean something and not simply a count. For example, a metric that indicates a  number of people who receive training does not necessarily correlate to knowledge.   Offer fewer, more meaningful metrics rather than a laundry list that will not be  tracked.   Provide data for accountability, guiding action, telling a story, and measuring success.   Be adaptable and scale with the effort and do not become unwieldy.", "968": "Measure Outputs or Outcomes? Metrics can be designed to measure output (quantitative) and/or an outcome (quali- tative). If the data is available, outputs are relatively easy to track. Examples of outputs  are number of dollars spent or saved, acres of land preserved, or number of staff hired.  However, an output metric does not necessarily demonstrate the quality or success of a  strategy only that something has been done.  An outcome based metric, on the other hand, is more qualitative and tends to measure  the value and effectiveness of a strategy. Examples of outcome metrics could be the  ecological health of preserved land, or community awareness and preparedness for a  disaster.", "969": "Align with Goals and Strategies Metrics and Resilience Goals, as described in Step 2: Assess, should be linked and  designed to be measured.

Broader goals will require more discussion  about specific and useful metrics and may require multiple, phased metrics (i.e., a  measurement that changes over time) to help measure progress.

Make sure that the metrics provide data that can be easily  reported and shared regularly.   Versatile and adaptable. Measurement systems can be adapted for an individual  agencys needs and preferences. Metrics with different evaluation methods can  coexist.    Up-to-date and relevant.

Self-evaluation can be an informal process or  a formal outreach and evaluation process.  Use self-evaluation to:   Track overall progress toward goals and identifying major barriers;   Examine the overall effectiveness of a process;    Evaluate the stakeholder engagement process and how it influenced the outcome of  the project;   Identify and solve technical or process challenges such as data acquisition, staffing,  or funding; and   Determine next steps that have emerged from unexpected findings, as a result of  new opportunities, or through changes to decision making.

In older cities with combined  sewer systems, NBS can also reduce the untreated  sewage going into community waterways. Combined  sewer systems send all stormwater and sewage to  a wastewater treatment plant before releasing the  treated wastewater into waterways. When it rains,  these systems sometimes carry more water than the  treatment plant can handle. As a result, some of the  mixed stormwater and sewage will be released untreated  into waterways. These events are called combined sewer  overflows (CSOs). By lowering the volume of rainwater  flowing into a combined sewer system, NBS can reduce  CSOs and improve water quality. The City of Lenexa, Kansas focuses on  nature-based solutions to prevent stormwater  pollution and reduce stormwater runoff.   Cleaner water supplies: Nature-based solutions that  protect the land around drinking water reservoirs can  keep polluted runoff away from a communitys water  supply. New York City has high-quality tap water because  the city invested in nature-based solutions around its  19 reservoirs. The citys $600 million investment to  conserve and restore the land keeps the water draining  into the reservoirs clean. It provided the same level of  service as the $6 billion water filtration plant that the city  would have needed otherwise.   Improved air quality: Trees, parks, and other plant-based,  nature-based solutions can absorb and filter pollutants  and reduce air temperatures. Doing so reduces smog and  improves air quality.   Healthier wildlife habitats: Watershed and shoreline  nature-based solutions preserve open space and  natural environments. If thoughtfully designed, they  can also connect habitats to give plants and animals  more space to move across the landscape. Both types  of nature-based solutions protect aquatic and wildlife  habitats by improving water quality. Economic Benefits  Increased property values: If a property is near a park  or has more landscaping, it generally has a higher value.  A study of 193 public parks in Portland, Oregon found  that parks had a significant, positive impact on nearby  property values. A park within 1,500 feet of a home  increased its sale price by $1,290 to $3,455 (adjusted  to 2020 dollars). As parks increased in size, their impact  on property value grew.  Improved property tax base: Nature-based solutions  can improve the tax base in both high-growth and  low-growth communities. In high-growth areas,  nature-based features translate into a higher property  tax base. In low-growth communities, nature-based  solutions can stabilize property values in areas with  high vacancies.", "1001": "Green jobs: Green stormwater infrastructure creates  new job opportunities in sectors like landscape  design, paving, and construction.

The  best part about this job growth is that many of  these jobs are local, providing an extra boost to  the local economy.  Improved triple bottom line: The triple bottom line is an  accounting framework that measures the value of social  and environmental benefits, as well as financial benefits.  Nature-based solutions provide more triple bottom line  benefits than traditional, gray infrastructure. As a result,  they increases a communitys return on investment. Social Benefits  Added recreational space: Nature-based solutions  that preserve and enhance open space provide more  areas for recreation.

Since nature-based solutions  provide many different co-benefits, a single project may  be eligible for a variety of private, state, and federal grant  programs. The key to leveraging These resources is to think  outside the box when applying for funding, and to apply to  diverse programs. For example, a coastal community may  seek grant funding for a flood risk reduction project that  uses nature-based approaches. In addition to applying for  hazard mitigation grants, this community could apply for  habitat conservation grants, water quality grants, and coastal  resilience grants. The final section of this guide lists some  of the most common federal grant funding opportunities for  nature-based solutions. Communities should also identify  and leverage the financial assistance available through  state-specific programs. Other potential sources are non-profit  organizations, special districts, and private foundations", "1038": "Building Nature-Based Solutions into the  Capital Improvement Plan The Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) process is another tool  for increasing investments in nature-based solutions. Many  communities use a CIP to plan the timing and financing of  public improvements over the medium term (approximately  five years). Agencies submit projects to be evaluated and  included in the CIP, and the CIP team analyzes and ranks  submitted projects. Ultimately, highly ranked projects  are funded first. Rankings often consider how the project  advances mandated activities and community priorities. They  are also based on whether the project is fiscally responsible.  Including a nature-based component can help increase a  projects ranking, as nature-based solutions may contribute  toward federal Clean Water Act requirements, hazard  mitigation, and other community priorities. It is important to  emphasize the multi-functional nature of these solutions and  how they can provide more bang for the publics buck", "1039": "Funding Nature-Based Solutions with  Stormwater Utility Fees Stormwater utility fee programs are designed to pay for the  cost of managing stormwater runoff. Typically, stormwater  fees are collected in a fund dedicated to the stormwater  management program and stormwater-related projects.  This can be a good, steady source of funding that does  not compete with other community priorities.  Many stormwater utilities are structured to charge users  based on their propertys stormwater runoff volume.  For example, communities can charge a fee based on a  propertys impervious area, rather than its total area. For  this type of fee structure, communities need to have a  good understanding of their impervious cover. Stormwater  utilities are also able to collect fees from all property owners,  including those otherwise exempt from property taxes.  The 2017 Western Kentucky University Stormwater Utility  Survey identified 1,639 stormwater utility programs in  40 states. The smallest program served a population of 88. ", "1040": "Financing Nature-Based Solutions with the Clean Water  State Revolving Fund The Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) is a financial  assistance program established through the Clean Water Act.  It provides low-interest loans for water infrastructure projects  (including nature-based solutions) that address water quality.  The EPA provides funding to all 50 states and Puerto Rico  to operate CWSRF programs. States provide a 20-percent  match for all federal funds. Since the CWSRF was established,  it has supplied more than $43 billion to state programs.  With that support, states have given $133 billion in loans  to communities.  For most projects, public, private, and non-profit entities  get an average interest rate of 1.4 percent. The loan period  must not exceed 30 years. A key benefit of the programs low  interest rate is that communities may be able to cover debt  service payments without raising the rates for local taxes or  fees. By further reducing operation and maintenance costs  for infrastructure, nature-based solutions help communities  meet their loan repayment terms.", "1041": "Public-Private Partnerships Through partnerships, local governments and private-sector  parties can invest together in public asset or service projects.  These long-term partnerships are most successful when they  have shared goals and benefits. Private partners may have  more flexibility than a public agency. Linking any partnership  with performance-based payments can encourage  efficiencies in time and cost.  Local officials can work with private partners to develop and  finance nature-based solutions in many ways. One key step  is to demonstrate the benefits of nature-based solutions  to  make the business case locally. Another is to offer continued  technical assistance and coordination for nature-based  projects. This may include policy support, training, or other  ways to build capacity. Finally, seek long-term agreements  with any private stakeholders that would provide these  services traditionally delivered by the public sector. Above all,  communities should create partnerships with private parties  for specific projects.  ", "1042": "Rebates and Financing Programs Rebates, tax credits, or low-interest loans can encourage  nature-based solutions and practices. For example, Tucson  Water sponsors a Rainwater Harvesting rebate program. It  provides rebates of up to $2,000 to single-family residential  or small commercial customers who install a rainwater  harvesting system. Eligible options include passive rainwater  harvesting, which directs and retains water in the landscape,  and active rainwater harvesting, such as tanks that store  water for later use. Often, participants in this kind of program  need capital at the beginning of a project. Since residents  may not want or be able to fund improvements on their  own, many communities target their rebates and loans at  businesses. Philadelphia, for example, offers low interest  (1 percent) loans for nature-based solutions retrofits on  non-residential property.  Another finance option for promoting nature-based solutions  is the Department of Energy's Property Assessed Clean  Energy (PACE). Communities can use PACE to help property  owners finance nature-based solutions. It also applies to  installing renewable energy or energy-efficient assets on  private properties. Depending on state laws, communities  can create PACE programs by issuing a revenue bond to the  property owner. PACE borrowers can benefit immediately  from new nature-based solutions and repay their debt by  increasing property taxes. For example, increases are at a  set rate for an agreed-upon term, typically 525 years. The  PACE assessment is attached as a tax on the property, not  the property owner. Because PACE is funded through private  loans or municipal bonds, it creates no liability to local  government funds.", "1043": "Grants and Cost-Share Agreements Communities can also encourage nature-based solutions  by directly funding property owners or groups. Onondaga  County, New York has a Green Improvement Fund that  funds nature-based solutions on private commercial and  non-profit properties. Applicants in the target sewer districts  can choose their own nature-based solutions techniques,  but grants are determined by the amount of stormwater  the project captures. The Green Improvement Fund has  awarded 88 grants since 2010, for a total of nearly $11  million. Nature-based solutions projects have included the  installation of porous pavement, added green space, rain  gardens, green roofs, and infiltration projects. Together, the  completed projects can capture more than 38 million gallons  of stormwater runoff per year. Philadelphia manages a similar  voluntary retrofit grant program. It covers the upfront costs  of typical nature-based solutions on private property if the  owner agrees to maintain it.", "1044": "Banking or Credit Trading  Banking or credit trading programs can help developers meet  onsite stormwater retention requirements when nature-based  solutions are not feasible onsite. They create a mechanism  for developers to pay the community to build nature-based  solutions off site. This concept is like that of wetland  mitigation banking. ", "1045": "Environmental Impact Bonds Several traditional debt financing tools are available to  communities. However, environmental impact bonds (EIBs)  are a recent innovation. EIBs can help communities obtain  upfront capital for hard-to-finance environmental projects.  These bonds link project performance incentives to desired  environmental outcomes. In practice, most EIBs function like  traditional bonds, with a fixed interest rate and term. Unlike  normal bonds, they offer investors a performance payment  if projects perform better than expected. The primary benefit  of this model is that it shifts the project performance risk to  a private party and ties borrowing costs to the effectiveness  of a project. If a project underperforms, investors must  reimburse the borrowing entity; if it overperforms, the entity  pays the investors. This model has potential applications for  multiple areas of environmental restoration and resilience,  including nature-based solutions.", "1046": "Development or Redevelopment Incentives Communities can update their land use, zoning, or other  local regulations to provide incentives for using nature-based  solutions. Zoning incentives can allow a greater height,  density, or intensity of development if a developer uses  nature-based approaches. One common zoning incentive  is an increased floor-to-area ratio (FAR), which regulates  the density of development on a site. The City of Portland,  Oregon offers increased FAR as an incentive for installing  green roofs. Communities can also exempt green roofs  or pervious pavements from any regulations that apply to  impervious cover.  More incentives for adopting nature-based solutions  approaches can be used in the development application  and review period. These include discounted application  fees and discounted or waived maintenance bonding  requirements. The City of Chicago, Illinois waives permit fees  for developments that meet specific nature-based solutions  thresholds. For redevelopment, communities can also give a  one-time tax credit for using nature-based approaches that  benefit the public.  More communities are moving from strict standards to  more flexible instruments that include incentives. They are  encouraging developers to use nature-based solutions through  unified development ordinances. They are providing options for  flexibility and creativity during the site plan review process", "1047": "Stormwater Utility Incentives Communities can use a local stormwater utility fee program  to establish a dedicated funding stream for nature-based  solutions. This type of program can offer incentives for  property owners to incorporate nature-based solutions.  For example, a program that charges users based on their  propertys impervious area could offer discounts when  property owners disconnect some of their impervious  area from the storm sewer system by adding nature-based  solutions.

This could apply to  public or private structures as well as critical facilities  and infrastructure. Examples are acquisitions, elevation,  utility undergrounding, and structural retrofits. This  type of action also involves construction of manmade  structures that reduce the impact of hazards, such as  floodwalls, retaining walls, detention and retention  structures, culverts, and safe rooms. Many of these types  of projects are eligible for funding through the FEMA  Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs.4", "1088": "Natural Systems Protection These are actions that minimize damage and losses and  preserve or restore the functions of natural systems.

A greater understanding and awareness of hazards and  risk is more likely to lead to direct action.", "1090": "Comprehensive or General Plans A comprehensive or general plan sets the overall policy  direction for a communitys future development. Depending  on State planning enabling legislation, local land use policy  and related development regulations may be required to  conform to comprehensive plan policies. However, even  in situations where such a legal requirement does not  exist, a comprehensive plan can give additional credibility  for implementing mitigation actions. Integrating hazard  mitigation goals into comprehensive plans can elevate the  importance of hazard mitigation throughout the planning  framework. The content of comprehensive plans varies depending on  State or local requirements, as well as the unique needs of  a community, but generally may include some or all of the  following elements:   Community vision and overall goals;   Existing conditions;   Land use;    Transportation;    Housing;    Environmental and natural resources conservation;    Recreation and open space;    Cultural resources;    Historic preservation;    Economic development;    Public facilities and services;    Capital improvements;   Implementation;   Goals, policies, and objectives relating to each plan   element; and   Mapping of existing and future land uses,   infrastructure, public facilities, and environmental   features", "1091": "Consider including hazard identification, risk assessment  information, and hazard mitigation goals in the comprehensive  plan.

Other development regulations may include  subdivision ordinances, design standards, site development  standards such as landscaping standards, overlay zoning, and  critical areas regulations. Floodplain development regulations,  which are required of communities that participate in the  NFIP, would be included in this category as well. These types of regulations provide many effective ways to  address resiliency to known hazards. Zoning, including  overlay zones, can be used to guide development away from  hazard areas, such as by prohibiting development in a landslide  hazard area, or limiting specific uses, such as prohibiting the  placement of hospitals or other essential community facilities  in a floodplain. Subdivision, site development, and critical  areas ordinances can affect the location of development  as well, either through development restrictions such as  prohibiting development immediately adjacent to the urban/ wildland interface, or through flexible permitting provisions  such as planned unit developments, cluster subdivisions, or  8 For more information on Integrating a Health and Safety Element in a  General Plan, go to:  http://www.countyofkings.com/planning/2035%20General%20Plan.html density transfer that allow for intensive use of suitable land  in exchange for the preservation of land more at risk from  hazards.", "1095": "Capital Improvement and Infrastructure Programs Capital Improvement Programs (CIPs) and other  infrastructure-related programs such as Transportation  Improvement Programs (TIPs) establish spending priorities,  typically over a five or six year period.

If the community and its elected  officials understand how their zoning and subdivision  ordinances allow growth in hazardous areas, they  can revise these ordinances before property owners  embark on risky projects. If they understand how  their comprehensive plans fail to guide growth to safe  locations, they can amend the plans. If they understand  how their capital improvement programs encourage  unsafe growth, they can change their utility provision  policies.18 This statement raises the important point that leadership,  staff, and stakeholders be engaged in your Safe Growth Audit  and in integrating hazard mitigation into the community  planning frameworkwhich leads us into Step 2 of your  integration effort.", "1111": "Step 2: Inform and Engage Local Leadership, Staff,  and Stakeholders The importance of identifying, informing, and engaging  multiple stakeholders should not be lost on community  planners.

These mitigation policies and actions are identified  based on an assessment of hazards, vulnerabilities, and risks and  the participation of a wide range of stakeholders and the public  in the planning process. Benefits of mitigation planning include:  Identifying actions for risk reduction that are agreed upon  by stakeholders and the public.  Focusing resources on the greatest risks and vulnerabilities.

Your  community can develop its own single jurisdiction plan or work with neighboring jurisdictions on a multi- jurisdictional plan.  Establish the Planning Area The planning area refers to the geographic area covered by the plan. Generally, the planning area follows local  government1  jurisdictional boundaries, such as cities, townships, counties, or planning districts. However, planning  areas also may be defined by watersheds or other natural features, particularly where hazards create similar risks  across jurisdictional boundaries. A jurisdictions boundaries may also cross over or encompass other jurisdictions,  such as a fire protection district or a utility district.  The State Hazard Mitigation Officer (SHMO)2  or State emergency management agency can help communities  determine the appropriate planning area. This determination may be based on State planning goals and planning  grant funding priorities.  Mitigation Plan Updates  If you are updating your communitys plan, determine if the planning area defined in the previously approved  plan is still appropriate.

Assigning the agency or individual  that will lead the mitigation planning effort is an important initial decision. Many local agencies have interest and responsibility in mitigation and should be included in the planning process.  For example, both the emergency management and community planning and development staff in local government  have unique knowledge and experience to make them natural leaders for a mitigation planning process. Local  emergency management staff has an understanding of local threats and hazards, risks, and consequences and may  have more experience working with State and Federal agencies on mitigation projects and activities. Community  planning staff is familiar with zoning and subdivision regulations, land use plans, economic development initiatives,  and long-term funding and planning mechanisms to implement mitigation strategies, and they may be trained to  facilitate public outreach, conduct meetings, and develop a plan document.  Both community development and emergency management departments, among others, are capable of providing  leadership in the development of a local hazard mitigation plan. When determining leadership, consider who has  the time and resources to commit to the entire planning process.

Be aware of the available resourceshuman, technical, and financial that your jurisdiction has to complete this planning effort. Combining resources with other jurisdictions through a  multi-jurisdictional planning effort as described previously may save time and money, or may leverage subject matter  expertise. Alternatively, specific parts of the planning process or plan preparation may require technical assistance.  If outside technical assistance is needed to help develop the plan, consider how to leverage this assistance to build  long-term community capabilities.  Although developing a hazard mitigation plan does not require formal training in community planning,  engineering, or science, it may be helpful to get outside expertise in some areas. For instance, you could seek  assistance with:  Identifying hazards, assessing vulnerabilities, and understanding significant risks.  Facilitating planning team meetings, public involvement, and decision making activities.  Creating an organized and functional plan document, including maps or other graphics. There are several different options when considering outside assistance for plan development. Consider contracting  with your regional planning agency or working with a local university with planning or emergency management  degree programs. You may also contact another community that has already completed the planning process for  suggestions.

Demonstrates knowledge or experience with land use and community development.  Understands all the applicable policies and regulations as they apply to the mitigation plan, including Federal  law, FEMA guidance, and state and local ordinances.

You may consider how threats and hazards impact economic development, housing,  health and social services, infrastructure, or natural and cultural resources to determine what agencies and offices  to include. You could also build on your communitys existing Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). 1 This group deals with hazardous materials safety and may  also address other threats and natural hazards issues. In small  communities, LEPCs may be comprised of the same people and  organizations that are needed for the mitigation planning team.  Representatives from agencies involved in hazard mitigation  activities, agencies with the authority to regulate development,  and offices responsible for enforcing local ordinances are  important members of the planning team.

Core Planning Group  The Core Planning Group (CPG) was made up of County Steering Committee members and leaders from each Jurisdictional  Assessment Team. CPG members were typically representatives of their local emergency management, engineering,  planning, GIS, administration, public works, building, or highway departments. The CPG managed the overall plan activities  and directly contributed to the decision making process.  Jurisdictional Assessment Teams  The Jurisdictional Assessment Teams (JAT) were headed by a Team Leader who served and represented their interests on  the CPG. JATs included broader representation from within the individual jurisdictions, and many chose to align their JAT  with an existing Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

A plan that accurately reflects the communitys values and  priorities is likely to have greater legitimacy and buy-in and greater success in implementing mitigation actions  and projects to reduce risk. Federal regulation for mitigation plan approval requires that stakeholders and the general public are given  opportunities to be involved during the planning process and in the plans maintenance and implementation.

Element A3 The planning process shall include an  opportunity for the public to comment  on the plan during the drafting stage  and prior to plan approval. 44 CFR 201.6(b)(1)3-4 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 3 Create an Outreach Strategy mitigation planning process. With or without a designated PIO, the planning team can develop an effective outreach  strategy through the following steps: 1. Brainstorm outreach activities The planning team can conduct a brainstorming session to identify stakeholders during the project kickoff  meeting, as well as to determine when and how to conduct outreach activities. If completing a plan  update, the planning team should evaluate the stakeholders and the outreach activities involved in the  previous planning process and identify any necessary changes. 2. Determine public outreach objectives and schedule  What input do you need from stakeholders? What input do you want from the public? How can stakeholders and  the public contribute to the development of the capability review, risk assessment, and mitigation strategy? These  questions can help determine the objectives of your outreach strategy. As the project kicked off, the planning team  confirmed a schedule of tasks and meetings for completing the plan or plan update. Revisit this schedule and  identify the times when it is important to inform and seek input from stakeholders and the public. For example,  a good time to invite public involvement is after the risk assessment is complete and the planning team begins to  create the mitigation strategy. Involving the public at this stage provides the opportunity to educate them on the  risk assessment findings, collect input on any data inaccuracies, and understand their ideas and priorities for various  mitigation actions.  3. Identify appropriate outreach methods  What are the best methods for reaching out to stakeholders and the public? This may be driven by planning needs,  schedule, and budget as defined by the planning team. Stakeholders should be engaged using targeted methods  for specific input. Online surveys, one-on-one briefings, phone interviews, roundtable discussions, presentations  to specific groups, and personal invitations to public outreach activities are all potential methods to involve  stakeholders. If your community has recently been affected by a disaster event, the public may have a heightened interest in  hazards and mitigation. Use this interest to get community members engaged in finding ways to avoid the impacts  of future events. A public meeting that primarily focuses on hazard mitigation may not be well attended, if the  community has not recently been affected by hazard events. Use the planning team to help identify what methods  of public involvement have previously worked well in your community. It helps to reach out to people instead  of asking them to come to you. For example, setting up a booth at a popular community event or getting on the  agenda of a scheduled meeting could reach a greater number of people than a meeting that solely discusses hazard  mitigation.  A variety of informational materials and methods, such as news media, social media, fliers, surveys, and websites,  are useful for reaching out to the public during the planning process. Consider messages for Twitter and content for  sharing on Facebook. Public involvement activities should include methods designed to improve public awareness  by presenting information (one-way communication), as well as to solicit input to inform the plans content  (two-way communication).  As with all public outreach materials and activities, ensure equal access and meaningful participation of all  individuals with access and functional needs, including individuals from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds,  with and without limited English proficiency, seniors, children, and members of underserved populations.  Table 3.1 provides examples of how communities have successfully used different types of outreach methods in  mitigation planning. 3-5 Task 3 Create an Outreach Strategy Table 3.1: Example Outreach Methods in Mitigation Planning Outreach Method Community Example Community  Events At the annual fair in Howard County, Maryland, the Office of Emergency Management has a booth to educate  residents on preparing for natural hazards. Brochures and fliers on related topics are distributed to visitors. Interviews The focus of the hazard mitigation planning process for Oakland County, Michigan was a series of structured  discussions with County officials, municipal officials, affected stakeholders, and the general public. This broad  outreach effort included telephone and face-to-face interviews with leaders and representatives from each of the  Countys 62 communities, 28 public schools districts, and 2 public universities to identify hazards of concern  and potential mitigation measures. News Media The mitigation planning process in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina included extensive outreach to local  media outlets. In response, the local television, radio and print media partners prepared stories to help promote  widespread public involvement. Through the City of Charlottes Corporate Communications & Marketing Office,  e-blasts soliciting input on draft plan documents as well as public meeting attendance were sent out using  distribution lists that included government agencies, businesses, and civic organizations. Public meeting  information was sent to all City and County employees, posted to the communitys online public events calendar,  added to live tickers that scrolled across the bottom of the local government access television channel, and  shared through C-Mail (bi-weekly e-newsletter for City of Charlotte news and events). In addition, live television  coverage of public input meetings was provided with the ability for citizens to submit their questions or  comments by e-mail. Presentations  to Governing  Bodies During the development of a Multi-jurisdictional Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan for Garfield County, Colorado  the Steering Committee made several presentations to the Board of County Commissioners about the status of  the plan. These meetings were public and announcement of the plan agenda item was included along with the  announcement of the public meeting. Questionnaires/ Surveys In completing its first hazard mitigation plan, Catawba County, North Carolina used a survey to capture  information from people who might not have been able to attend the public meetings or participate through  other means in the mitigation planning process. Copies of the survey were distributed by local officials and  made available for residents to complete at local county and municipal offices, and an electronic version was  posted on their websites. Nearly 250 respondents to the survey provided input for the Countys planning team to  consider in developing their mitigation strategy. Roundtables/ Forums  In order to solicit ideas from citizens on how to reduce the risk of natural hazards, the City of Everett, Washington  sponsored a public forum titled the Safe and Sound Summit: Help Everett Master Disaster. Attended by more  than 80 residents of the community, this was the primary public event designed to both educate the public and  to empower citizens to contribute to the hazard mitigation plans action items. The meeting format was adapted  from The World Caf method, a conversational process designed to bring people together to discuss questions  that matter through small group discussions that rotated between tables on different topics. The resulting ideas  helped the Citys planning team to identify risks, strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities in Everett. Social Media Clark County, Kansas (population 1,950) used computer technology to obtain public input by creating the Clark  County, Kansas Hazard Mitigation Plan Facebook page. They included small video clips with community leaders  talking about the importance of mitigation planning. Additionally, the Facebook page was used to hold a drawing  for an Apple iPod Shuffle 2GB MP3 Player posting that all those that participate and provide feedback via this  Facebook page will be entered in the drawing. Area-specific  Meetings The City of Tulsa, Oklahoma holds small, area-specific meetings on a semi-annual basis at public libraries and  other public venues. These meetings are used to distribute literature and educate citizens on actions they can  take to mitigate natural hazards, save lives, and prevent property damage. Input also is solicited about how the  mitigation process can be more effective. Website Pinal County, Arizona used their website to promote the mitigation plan by providing a definition of hazard  mitigation planning, a list of who is involved in the local planning process, a description of how the plan update  process works, and information about upcoming stakeholder meetings and opportunities for public involvement.  Point of contact information was also provided for questions or comments. Downloads available from the site  include copies of the existing plan, the plan update, public notices, and press releases.3-6 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 3 Create an Outreach Strategy 4. Develop clear and consistent messages that align with community values Consider the overarching goals and values of the community and how they align with reducing the impacts of  future hazards and disasters. Then, personalize talking points for discussions with different audiences and develop  messages that appeal to them. For example, if a gold-medal trout stream or historic downtown is important to a  communitys identity and economy, then frame mitigation messages to emphasize these assets and the need for their  long-term protection.  5. Evaluate and incorporate feedback from outreach activities The feedback you receive through outreach activities, such as completed questionnaires and surveys, comments at  meetings, and comments on plan drafts, should be evaluated and incorporated into the planning teams decision  making process and the final plan. During the outreach process, clearly communicate to stakeholders and the public  how the planning team uses their feedback to inform the plan. Develop a process for organizing and evaluating the  comments received, as well as documenting them in the final plan. 6. Provide an opportunity for public review of the final draft plan The public must be given the opportunity to review and comment  on the final draft plan prior to its adoption. This may be done by  providing copies of the draft plan in the local library, city hall,  or community center, as well as posting it on the communitys  website. Consider allowing at least four weeks for review and  comment and providing some guidance on the type of comments  and feedback that you are seeking. For instance, it is helpful to  get feedback from the public on the identification of community  assets and the prioritization of the mitigation actions in the plan.  Inform the public through a press release in the local newspaper  and on the communitys website when a draft is available for review and how they may provide comment. Some  jurisdictions have policies in place for the public review of documents prior to adoption, which should be followed  for the final comment period for the mitigation plan.", "1194": "Continuing Public Outreach over Time The outreach strategy should address both the planning process and how to keep people engaged after the plans  adoption. Ongoing outreach continues the discussion with the community about hazards and risks, builds support  for implementation of mitigation activities, and informs the outreach strategy for the next plan update process.  The plan must describe how the jurisdictions will continue  public participation during the plans implementation and  maintenance.  The outreach activities conducted during the planning process, as  described above, are a good source of ideas for how to continue  to involve stakeholders and the public during plan maintenance  and implementation. Consider repeating successful outreach  events annually. Other examples of activities for continued  public participation include periodic presentations on the plans  progress to elected officials, schools, or other community groups;  annual questionnaires or surveys; postings on social media and  email lists; and interactive websites. You may help build capabilities throughout the planning area by assigning the  responsibility for coordinating these activities to a staff member in each jurisdiction.  Coordinating a Multi-Jurisdictional Outreach Strategy If you are developing a multi-jurisdictional plan, the outreach strategy creates a mechanism for coordination and  accountability among the jurisdictions. For each jurisdiction seeking plan approval, the plan must document how  they were involved in the planning process, including how they provided opportunities for the involvement of their  stakeholders and the public.  Task 2 describes ways that the representatives on multi-jurisdictional planning teams can share information with  their respective community stakeholders and citizens. Specific stakeholders may be identified for each participating  jurisdiction, and public involvement activities should be designed to reach citizens throughout the planning area.  The planning team may develop one set of outreach materials, which each jurisdiction is responsible for distributing  or hosting to reach their stakeholders and citizens. Another good approach is to develop one presentation, or a series  of presentations on the plans progress, that jurisdictional representatives can deliver at a regularly scheduled open  meeting of their city council or governing body. This is a good method to keep elected officials informed of the  planning project and to give the public an opportunity to be informed and provide comments.  ", "1195": "Capability Assessment Each community has a unique set of capabilities, including  authorities, policies, programs, staff, funding, and other  resources available to accomplish mitigation and reduce long- term vulnerability. By reviewing the existing capabilities in each  jurisdiction, the planning team can identify capabilities that  currently reduce disaster losses or could be used to reduce losses  in the future, as well as capabilities that inadvertently increase risks  in the community. This is especially useful for multijurisdictional  plans where local capability varies widely. Task 6 describes how to  leverage capabilities for long-term vulnerability reduction in your  mitigation strategy. The planning team collects and reviews information on community  capabilities. The plan must describe each jurisdictions existing  authorities, policies, programs, and resources available to accomplish hazard mitigation. To review capabilities, begin  by reviewing existing plans, reports, and information and interviewing local departments and agencies to gain a  better understanding of relevant programs, regulations, resources, and practices. One approach is to distribute a  capabilities worksheet for each planning team members community or agency to complete. Appendix A includes an  example capabilities worksheet (see Worksheet 4.1).  Types of Capabilities The primary types of capabilities for reducing long-term  vulnerability through mitigation planning are the following:  Planning and regulatory  Administrative and technical   Financial  Education and outreach The planning team also may identify additional types of  capabilities relevant to mitigation planning.  ", "1196": "Planning and Regulatory Planning and regulatory capabilities are based on the  implementation of ordinances, policies, local laws and State statutes, and plans and programs that relate to guiding  and managing growth and development. Examples of planning capabilities that can either enable or inhibit  mitigation include comprehensive land use plans, capital improvements programs, transportation plans, small area  development plans, disaster recovery and reconstruction plans, and emergency preparedness and response plans.  Plans describe specific actions or policies that support community goals and drive decisions. Likewise, examples of  Element C1 The plan shall include a mitigation  strategy that provides the  jurisdictions blueprint for reducing  the potential losses identified in the  risk assessment, based on existing  authorities, policies, programs, and  resources, and its ability to expand  on and improve these existing tools. 44 CFR 201.6(c)(3) Safe Growth Audit One way to assess the impact of planning and  regulatory capabilities is to complete a safe  growth audit.* The purpose of the safe growth  audit is to analyze the impacts of current policies,  ordinances, and plans on community safety from  hazard risks due to growth. Basic safe growth  audit questions are included in Appendix A (see  Worksheet 4.2). * Godschalk, David R., Practice Safe Growth Audits;  Zoning Practice, Issue Number 10, October 2009;  American Planning Association. http://www.planning. org/zoningpractice/open/pdf/oct09.pdf4-2 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 4 Review Community Capabilities regulatory capabilities include the enforcement of zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, and building codes  that regulate how and where land is developed and structures are built. Planning and regulatory capabilities refer not  only to the current plans and regulations, but also to the communitys ability to change and improve those plans and  regulations as needed.", "1197": "Administrative and Technical  Administrative and technical capability refers to the communitys staff and their skills and tools that can be used  for mitigation planning and to implement specific mitigation actions. It also refers to the ability to access and  coordinate these resources effectively. Think about the types of personnel employed by each jurisdiction, the public  and private sector resources that may be accessed to implement mitigation activities in your community, and the  level of knowledge and technical expertise from all of these sources. These include engineers, planners, emergency  managers, GIS analysts, building inspectors, grant writers, floodplain managers, and more. For jurisdictions with  limited staff resources, capacity should also be considered; while staff members may have specific skills, they may  not have the time to devote to additional work tasks.  The planning team can identify resources available through other government entities, such as counties or special  districts, which may be able to provide technical assistance to communities with limited resources. For example, a  small town may turn to county planners, engineers, or a regional planning agency to support its mitigation planning  efforts and provide assistance. For large jurisdictions, reviewing administrative and technical capabilities may  involve targeting specific staff in various departments who have the expertise and are available to support mitigation  initiatives. The degree of intergovernmental coordination among departments also affects administrative capability.", "1198": "Financial Financial capabilities are the resources that a jurisdiction has access to or is eligible to use to fund mitigation  actions. The costs associated with implementing mitigation activities vary. Some mitigation actions such as building  assessment or outreach efforts require little to no costs other than staff time and existing operating budgets. Other  actions, such as the acquisition of flood-prone properties, could require a substantial monetary commitment from  local, State, and Federal funding sources.  Some local governments may have access to a recurring source of revenue beyond property, sales, and income taxes,  such as stormwater utility or development impact fees. These communities may be able to use the funds to support  local mitigation efforts independently or as the local match or cost-share often required for grant funding.", "1199": "Education and Outreach  This type of capability refers to education and outreach programs and methods already in place that could be used  to implement mitigation activities and communicate hazard-related information. Examples include fire safety  programs that fire departments deliver to students at local schools; participation in community programs, such  as Firewise1 or StormReady; 2  and activities conducted as part of hazard awareness campaigns, such as Tornado or  Flood Awareness Month. Some communities have their own public information or communications office to handle  outreach initiatives.", "1200": "Documentation of Community Capabilities The plan must document what existing plans, studies, reports, and  technical information were reviewed and how relevant information  was incorporated into the mitigation plan. To document means to  provide the factual evidence for how the jurisdictions developed  the plan. Documentation can be met with a narrative description,  but may also be shown in other formats. For example, a table or  list format may provide the relevant sources and explain how  information was incorporated, or citations or footnotes throughout  the document may demonstrate incorporation of other plans.  For multi-jurisdictional plans, the capabilities of each participating jurisdiction must be individually  reviewed and documented. In a plan update, the planning team ensures capabilities are documented  sufficiently and highlights any capability changes from the previous plan.", "1201": "The planning team conducts a risk assessment to determine the potential impacts of hazards to the people, economy,  and built and natural environments of the community. The risk assessment provides the foundation for the rest of  the mitigation planning process, which is focused on identifying and prioritizing actions to reduce risk to hazards.  In addition to informing the mitigation strategy, the risk assessment also can be used to establish emergency  preparedness and response priorities, for land use and comprehensive planning, and for decision making by elected  officials, city and county departments, businesses, and organizations in the community.  Task 5 presents a framework for conducting a local risk assessment. Many approaches to developing a risk assessment  are possible, depending on available data, technology, and resources. Local risk assessments do not require  sophisticated technology but do need to be accurate, current, and relevant. Some communities may choose to  address a broader range of threats and hazards, or to tie their hazard identification and risk assessment to other  planning initiatives.", "1202": "Steps to Conduct a Risk Assessment Figure 5.2 shows the four recommended steps for conducting a risk  assessment. The desired outcomes of these steps are 1) an evaluation of  each hazards potential impacts on the people, economy, and built and  natural environments in the planning area and 2) an understanding of  each communitys overall vulnerability and most significant risks. These  potential impacts and the overall vulnerability can be used to create problem  statements and identify mitigation actions to reduce risk. For multi-jurisdictional planning efforts, the risk assessment must result  in an evaluation of potential impacts and overall vulnerability that each  participating jurisdiction will use to development specific mitigation actions.  Assets, vulnerabilities, and overall risk are unique to each community and  must be addressed in a multi-jurisdictional plan. Although hazards  may be described for the entire planning area, the plan also must  explain any hazards that are unique or varied within communities.  A mitigation plan update focuses on how risk has  changed since the previous plan was completed,  particularly changes related to land use development  and new hazard information. New development in  hazard-prone areas, areas affected by recent disasters, and new  data and reports are examples of information that should be  incorporated into the plan to analyze the current risk and update  problem statements. Because the best available data is constantly changing, this Handbook does not include a comprehensive list of  resources. The local community is the best source for specific information on community assets and past impacts.  Your State Hazard Mitigation Officer and the State Hazard Mitigation Plan are also key resources for best available  hazard data and risk assessment information.  ", "1203": "1. Describe Hazards The plan must include a description of the natural hazards that  affect the jurisdiction(s) in the planning area. The following  provides suggestions for identifying hazards in the planning area:   Review your State Hazard Mitigation Plan for information on  hazards affecting the planning area.  Document the disaster declaration history.1  Download weather-related events from online resources, such  as the National Climatic Data Center. 2  Review existing studies, reports, and plans related to hazards in  the planning area. State and Federal agencies are also good sources for hazard-related information. 1 For recent disaster declaration information, visit FEMAs Federal Disaster Declarations webpage, http://www.fema.gov/news/disasters.fema.  PERI Presidential Disaster Declarations are available at http://www.peripresdecusa.org/mainframe.htm.

Interview your planning team and stakeholders about which hazards affect the planning area and should be  described in the mitigation plan.   Consult local resources such as the newspaper, chamber of commerce, local historical society, or other resources  with records of past occurrences.  For plan updates, reference hazards previously identified and determine if they are still relevant.  If your plan omits a natural hazard that is commonly recognized to affect the planning area, it must include the  planning teams rationale for the omission. For example, a hazard may be possible, but the likelihood and magnitude  are so minimal that the planning team decides not to provide a detailed description or risk assessment.  Hazard Descriptions For each hazard affecting the planning area, the risk assessment must include a description of location,  extent, previous occurrences, and probability of future events. Plan updates will incorporate any additional  hazards that have been identified and any new data that has become available, such as new flood studies.  Plan updates must include hazard events that have occurred since the last plan was completed. Location. Location is the geographic areas within the planning area that are affected by the hazard, such as a  floodplain. Hazard areas may be further defined, such as high wildfire hazard areas versus low wildfire hazard areas.  The entire planning area may be uniformly affected by some hazards, such as drought or winter storm. Although  maps are usually the best way to illustrate location for many hazards, location may be described in other formats,  such as a narrative.  Extent. Extent is the strength or magnitude of the hazard. Extent can be described in a combination of ways  depending on the hazard, such as:  The value on an established scientific scale or measurement system, such as EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale for  tornadoes or 5.5 on the Richter Scale for earthquakes.   Other measures of magnitude, such as water depth or wind speed.  The speed of onset. For example, hurricanes have longer warning times, giving people and governments more  time to prepare and evacuate, while earthquakes occur without warning.   The duration of hazard events. For most hazards, the longer the duration of an event, the greater the extent.  Flooding that peaks and retreats in a matter of hours is typically less damaging than flooding of the same depth  that remains in place for days.  Extent can be described using a map and/or narrative. Describing the extent of a hazard is not the same as  describing its potential impacts on a community. Extent defines the characteristics of the hazard regardless of  the people and property it affects, while impact refers to the effect of a hazard on the people and property in the  community and will be addressed later in Task 5.  3 More information on the Risk MAP program is available at http://www.fema.gov/rm-main.5-4 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 5 Conduct a Risk Assessment Previous occurrences. The plan must include the history of  previous hazard events for each hazard. This information helps  estimate the likelihood of future events and predict potential  impacts. For some hazards, it may be helpful to compile past  events in tables. When data is available, describe the extent of the  event and impacts, such as fatalities and injuries, building and  infrastructure damages, and loss of services. Understanding the  extent and impacts of past hazard events will help you anticipate  potential damage from future events.", "1204": "Probability of future events. Probability is the likelihood of the hazard occurring in the future and can be  described in a variety of ways. Probability may be defined using historical frequencies or statistical probabilities.  Statistical probabilities often refer to events of a specific size or strength. For example, the likelihood of a flood event  of a given size is defined by the percent chance in a single year, such as the one-percent annual chance of flood,  also known as a 100-year flood. Hazard likelihood can also be compared using general descriptions or rankings. If", "1205": "general descriptors are used, then they must be defined in the plan. For example, highly likely could be defined  as occurring every 1-10 years, likely as occurring every 10-50 years, and unlikely as occurring at intervals  greater than 50 years. Some hazards are most likely during a specific time of year, but others can occur at any time.  For example, flooding might be more frequent in the spring because of snow melt or during late summer or fall  because of the hurricane season.", "1206": "Displaying Hazard Information The following figures illustrate how communities have used maps to describe the location, extent, previous  occurrences, and/or probability of future events for various hazards.

Visiting populations include students, second home owners,  migrant farm workers, and visitors for special events. Special  events could include large sporting events and festivals where  large numbers of people are concentrated and vulnerable to  hazards and threats. Visiting populations may be less familiar  with the local environment and hazards and less prepared to  protect themselves during an event.

For instance,  wetlands and riparian areas help absorb flood waters, soils  and landscaping contribute to stormwater management,  and vegetation provides erosion control and reduces runoff.

The  purpose of this analysis is to help the community understand  the greatest risks facing the planning area. This step occurs after  hazards and assets have been identified.  Methods for analyzing risk include exposure analysis, historical  analysis, and scenario analysis. These methods can be expressed  qualitatively or quantitatively. Qualitative evaluations describe  the types of impacts that might occur during a hazard event.

For recent events, consider not only what was damaged, but what  might have been damaged if the event had been of greater magnitude. For hazard events that have not occurred  recently, consider new development and infrastructure that would  now be vulnerable in a similar event.

Summarize Vulnerability The previous three steps in the risk assessment process generate  large amounts of information regarding hazards, vulnerable  assets, and potential impacts and losses. This information needs  to be summarized so that the community can understand the  most significant risks and vulnerabilities, not only to inform the  mitigation strategy, but also to communicate findings to elected  officials and other stakeholders to support their decision making.  The plan must provide an overall summary of each jurisdictions  vulnerability to the identified hazards. One recommended approach is to develop problem statements. For instance, your analysis of impacts and losses  helps you to identify which critical facilities are located in identified hazard areas, the neighborhood that has  experienced the most flood damage in the past, or which hazard-prone areas are zoned for future development. This  information on the issues of greatest concern can be summarized into problem statements, such as in the following  examples. The planning team may evaluate the impacts and develop problem statements for each hazard, as well as  identify the problems or issues that apply to all hazards.

Examples include:  Creating mutual aid agreements with neighboring communities to meet emergency response needs.  Purchasing radio communications equipment for the Fire Department.  Developing procedures for notifying citizens of available shelter locations during and following an event. For some hazards, such as tornados, including preparedness actions in the mitigation plan may be necessary  and practical. The mitigation plan may be the best place for your community to capture and justify the need for  these actions.

For  example, building retrofits, infrastructure protection, and changes in local ordinances represent a mix of structural  and non-structural approaches. In addition, each jurisdiction must consider actions that reduce risk to existing  buildings and infrastructure, as well as limit risk to new development and redevelopment.  The planning team may identify low-cost mitigation actions that can be readily implemented, such as developing  an outreach program to encourage homeowners to secure furnishings and utilities to prevent injuries and damage  during an earthquake. Other actions may depend on available funding, such as retrofitting critical infrastructure.  Though funding and support may not be immediately available for every action, including the actions in the plan  may lead to future opportunities for implementation. For example, some actions can be implemented following a  disaster when additional funding and political and public support are available, such as acquiring homes in a flood  hazard area. Additionally, if actions are not included in the plan, securing funding may be more difficult once it  becomes available. To identify potential mitigation actions, the planning team needs to review the risk assessment and assess  capabilities.  1. Review Risk Assessment The planning team should start with the problem statements developed from the risk assessment. For each problem  statement, consider different types of mitigation actions for addressing the problem. See the example on the page  6-6.  You may have multiple ideas that are categorized under one type (e.g., education and awareness or local plans and  regulations) and no ideas under another type. However, the intent is to think comprehensively when identifying  potential actions and to consider future development.  ", "1241": ". Assess Capabilities The mitigation strategy is based on existing local authorities, policies, programs, and resources, as well as the ability  to expand on and improve these existing tools. As part of Task 4, the planning team reviewed existing capabilities for  reducing long-term vulnerability to hazards. Those capabilities can be assessed to identify gaps to be addressed and  strengths to enhance through new mitigation actions. For instance, can gaps in design or enforcement of existing  regulations be addressed through additional personnel or a change in procedure or policy? Could an existing  education program be improved to cover the most significant hazards and better target non-English speakers? Are  additional studies, reports, or plans needed to understand risk?  Jurisdictions participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) can consider actions to enhance their  floodplain management program, such as addressing repetitive loss properties and improving standards beyond the  minimum requirements for NFIP participation.  Communities also must consider actions that reduce risk to future development. The planning team can evaluate  the effects of current growth plans and regulations (i.e., comprehensive plans, zoning and subdivisions ordinances,  building codes, and capital improvement programs) on community safety and consider how these could be updated  to reduce the communitys vulnerability. For instance, development review procedures may be revised to include a  hazard assessment for new development. The types of questions that the community can ask include:  Will population growth and future land use plans put more people in hazardous areas?  Will current redevelopment policies increase the population and property vulnerable to hazards?  Will planned infrastructure extensions encourage unsafe development by facilitating access to hazardous areas?", "1242": "Evaluating and Prioritizing Mitigation Actions Not all of the identified actions may be included in the final action plan because of technical feasibility, political  acceptance, lack of funding, and other constraints. The planning team will evaluate and prioritize the most suitable  mitigation actions for the community to implement. The plan must include a mitigation strategy that 1) analyzes  actions and/or projects considered to reduce the impacts of hazards identified in the risk assessment and 2)  identifies the actions and/or projects that each jurisdiction intends to implement.  Benefit-Cost Review The one criterion that must be part of the evaluation and  prioritization process is benefit-cost review. That is, the planning  team must consider the benefits that would result from a  mitigation action versus the cost. This does not mean a full benefit- cost analysis, such as the FEMA BCA Module, 1  but a planning level  assessment of whether the costs are reasonable compared to the  probable benefits. Cost estimates do not have to be exact but can be  based on experience and judgment.  Benefits include losses avoided, such as the number and value  of structures and infrastructure protected by the action and the  population protected from injury and loss of life. Qualitative  benefits, such as quality of life and natural and beneficial functions  of ecosystems, can also be included in the review. Evaluation Criteria The planning team needs to agree upon the other criteria that will  be used to analyze the mitigation actions. Suggested criteria and  sample planning team questions to evaluate each mitigation action  alternative include:  Life safety. How effectively will the action protect lives and  prevent injuries?  Property protection. How significant will the action  be at eliminating or reducing damage to structures and  infrastructure?  Technical. Is the mitigation action technically feasible?  Is it a long-term solution? Eliminate actions that, from a  technical standpoint, will not meet the goals.   Political. Does the public support the mitigation action? Is  there the political will to support it?", "1243": "Legal. Does the community have the authority to implement the action?  Environmental. What are the potential environmental impacts of the action? Will it comply with environmental  regulations?   Social. Will the proposed action adversely affect one segment of the population? Will the action disrupt  established neighborhoods, break up voting districts, or cause the relocation of lower income people?  Administrative. Does the community have the personnel and administrative capabilities to implement the  action and maintain it, or will outside help be necessary?   Local champion. Is there a strong advocate for the action or project among local departments and agencies who  will support the actions implementation?  Other community objectives. Does the action advance other community objectives, such as capital  improvements, economic development, environmental quality, or open space preservation? Does it support the  policies of the comprehensive plan? Action Prioritization  After careful evaluation, the planning team will have a list of actions that are acceptable and practical for addressing  the problems identified in the risk assessment. The planning team can prioritize actions for implementation by  assessing the importance of each item relative to the plans goals and the risks and capabilities. Actions could  be prioritized by numerical ranking; high, medium, or low designation; chronological ranking by date of  implementation; or other methods. Prioritization may change over time in response to changes in community  characteristics and risks and to take advantage of available resources. The evaluation and prioritization process helps the planning team weigh the pros and cons of different action  alternatives. However, the decision-making process is not necessarily straightforward; it is highly specific to each  jurisdiction. The example that follows describes one approach for identifying and prioritizing mitigation actions.  Your process should be appropriate for the size, number, and capabilities of the communities involved. Each  participating jurisdiction may have different priorities for implementing actions. Appendix A includes an example of  a worksheet that could be used to facilitate the evaluation and prioritization process (see Worksheet 6.1).", "1244": "Incorporation into Existing Plans and Procedures For a community to succeed in reducing risks in the long term, the  information and recommendations of the mitigation plan should  be integrated throughout government operations. Through the  planning process, partnerships are formed, and sustained action  can increase the communitys resilience to disasters. Many other  local plans, such as comprehensive, stormwater management,  sustainability, economic development, and area plans present  opportunities to address hazard mitigation in a way that can  support multiple community objectives. Mitigation plans must  describe the communitys process to integrate the data, analysis,  and mitigation goals and actions into other planning mechanisms.  First, the plan must identify the existing planning mechanisms  where hazard mitigation information and actions may be incorporated. In this context, planning mechanisms mean  governance structures used to manage local land use development and community decision making. The review of  community capabilities described in Task 4 identifies this information. Multi-jurisdictional plans must describe each  participating jurisdictions individual process for integrating the plan into their local planning mechanisms. In some cases, a community may choose to develop their hazard mitigation plan wholly within their comprehensive  planning process. Hazard Mitigation: Integrating Best Practices into Planning2 provides technical advice and examples of  communities that have successfully integrated mitigation into local comprehensive plans and other types of  local planning processes. Some existing processes may not allow for integration due to timing, budgets, or other  constraints. For example, a community may determine that the goals and actions of the hazard mitigation plan will  be considered in the next 5-year capital improvements planning process, which may be updated annually.  To identify how the plan can be incorporated into other plans, programs, and procedures, consider the following:  Integrate Plan Goals with other Community Objectives The overall mission and goals for risk reduction and community  safety may be incorporated into the objectives and policies of  other plans. Goals for disaster resiliency can also complement  the sustainability programs being developed by many  communities. The following are examples of policies that can  be included in the comprehensive plan and are implemented  through zoning and building codes, capital improvements  programs, and permitting processes:   Protect life and property in high hazard areas by limiting  densities of new development   Limit the extension of public infrastructure in high hazard  areas  Reduce the vulnerability of future development in high  hazard areas by reviewing development regulations  ", "1245": "Use the Risk Assessment to Inform Plans and Policies The risk assessment provides data, analysis, and maps that can be integrated into other plans to inform policies and  decision-making. For instance, the risk assessment can form the basis for other emergency management program  activities, including the emergency operations and evacuation planning. Incorporation of hazard information and  mapping into land use plans, zoning and subdivision codes, and the development review process can guide growth  and redevelopment away from high-risk locations. This information can also be used to design and site future public  facilities to minimize exposure to hazards.  ", "1246": "Implement Mitigation Actions through Existing Mechanisms Where possible, the community should implement the identified mitigation actions through existing plans and  policies, which already have support from the community and policy makers. For instance, a Community Wildfire  Protection Plan3  identifies a communitys priorities for wildfire fuel reduction projects. A capital improvements  program outlines a jurisdictions spending plan for capital projects that support existing and future developments,  such as roads, water, and sewer systems, usually over a 5-year period. Mitigation projects that could be included in  the capital improvements plan include strengthening at-risk critical facilities or acquiring open space in identified  hazard areas. Other implementation tools for mitigation actions could include staff work plans, permitting  procedures, job descriptions, and training.", "1247": "Implementation of Mitigation Actions The action plan also identifies how specific mitigation actions will  be implemented, including who is responsible for which actions,  what funding mechanisms and other resources are available or  will be pursued, when the actions will be completed, and how  they are prioritized. The capability assessment developed in Task 4  can be helpful in determining the agencies responsible for certain  functions in the community and the available financial resources. Assign Responsible Agency The planning team needs to determine which department or  agency is most appropriate to lead each action. In order to clearly  describe how actions will be implemented and administered,  at a minimum, a specific agency, department, or position must  be assigned to the action, not the jurisdiction as a whole. If  coordinating with other agencies will be necessary, this is a good  time for them to provide input on the steps and timeframes  necessary to carry out the actions.", "1248": "Identify Potential Resources Resources include funding, technical assistance, and materials. Estimating the cost of an action will help the  planning team target the most appropriate resources. Sources of local funding may include the general operating  budget, capital improvement budgets, staff time, impact fees, special assessment districts, and more. Your State  Hazard Mitigation Officer and the FEMA mitigation planning webpage can help you identify potential State and  Federal resources. The planning team should also consider opportunities for private sector funding and partnerships,  as well as resources that may be provided by academic institutions. Estimate the Timeframe The planning team and responsible agencies must develop a timeframe for implementing each mitigation action.  Funding cycles can affect when you can begin implementing an action. The timeframe can detail when the action  will be started, interim steps, and when it should be fully implemented. Timeframes can also be general, such as 3  to 5 years, or defined for short, medium, and long term.  Other implementation items that you may consider describing in the action plan are goals addressed, partner  agencies, steps for implementation, and estimated budget. An action implementation worksheet can be a good  approach for formatting the information collected for each action and its implementation. An example worksheet  is provided in Appendix A (see Worksheet 6.2). The planning team may decide to assign the responsible agency for  each action first. Each agency can then be responsible for developing the action implementation worksheet with  additional information on how the action will be administered and implemented. If appropriate, the community  can also begin developing project scopes of work, schedules, and budgets, particularly where Federal funding  applications are anticipated. FEMAs approval of the plan does not mean approved funding for projects identified in  the plan or an approved application for Federal assistance.", "1249": "Updating the Mitigation Strategy One of the most important steps in updating your plan is to refine the communitys mitigation strategy, particularly  in light of experiences gained from the implementation of the previous plan. To continue to be an effective  representation of the jurisdictions overall strategy for reducing risk to natural hazards, the updated  local mitigation plan must reflect current conditions and progress in mitigation efforts. The 5-year plan  update is an opportunity for each jurisdiction to assess its previous goals and actions, evaluate progress in  implementing the action plan, and adjust its actions to address current realities. The mitigation strategy should also  be revised following disasters to determine if the recommended actions are still appropriate given the impacts of the  event.  Evaluate Progress in Implementation Plan updates must reflect progress in local mitigation efforts.  Whereas goals may not change significantly over a 5-year  timeframe, the integration of the plan into existing planning  mechanisms and the implementation of mitigation actions  demonstrate progress in risk reduction.", "1250": "Integration of Hazard Mitigation  The updated plan must explain how the jurisdiction(s)  incorporated the previous mitigation plan, when appropriate,  into other planning mechanisms over the last 5 years as a demonstration of progress in local mitigation efforts.  The updated plan must continue to describe how the current mitigation strategy, including the goals and hazard  mitigation actions, will be incorporated into other planning mechanisms over the next 5 years.", "1251": "Completion of Mitigation Actions The plan also must describe the status of the mitigation actions identified in the previous plan by describing those  that have been completed or not completed. For actions that have not been completed, the plan must either describe  whether the action is no longer relevant or indicate whether it is included as part of the updated action plan.  The planning team may ask the local agencies and departments assigned responsibility for the implementation of  mitigation actions in the previous plan to provide a status update on each of their actions. For instance, agencies  could provide an evaluation of the following:   If the action was completed, did it have the intended results? Did it achieve the goals outlined in the plan? What  factors contributed to success?  If the action was not completed, what were the barriers to implementation? For instance, was there a lack of  political support, funding, staff availability, or other obstacle? Should the action be included in the updated  mitigation strategy? Task 7 describes how to develop a process for monitoring and evaluating the plan that can be used to evaluate  progress.  ", "1252": "Describe Changes in Priorities The plan must describe if and how any priorities changed since  the plan was previously approved. Your communitys mitigation  priorities may change over time for a variety of reasons. Addressing  changes in priorities allows you to redirect actions to reflect  current conditions, including financial and political realities,  or changes in conditions or priorities due to disaster events. In  addition, now that the community has implemented some actions,  you may apply lessons learned about what works and does not.  New actions can be identified based on the updated risk assessment and capability assessment. New actions are  prioritized in combination with the actions carried forward from the previous plan. Factors that may influence  changes in priorities include the following:  Altered conditions due to disaster events and recovery priorities  Changing local resources, community needs, and capabilities  New State or Federal policies and funding resources  New hazard impacts identified in the updated risk assessment  Changes in development patterns that could influence the effects of hazards  New partners that have come to the table If no changes in priorities are necessary, plan updates may validate the information in the previously approved plan.", "1253": "Communicating the Mitigation Action Plan You may consider how to present the final action plan in a format that can be easily used and referenced by  community members and officials. The mitigation strategy or action plan is the primary tool to obtain funding,  assign priorities, guide the decision making process, and track progress in future plan updates. A matrix, such as the  example provided on page 6-14, can be a good format for summarizing information on the recommended actions.  You also may consider including this information along with the mission and goals in the front of the plan in the  form of an executive summary. This allows users to quickly understand how the community plans to reduce risk to  hazards and strengthen disaster resiliency.", "1254": "Plan Maintenance Procedures Plan maintenance is the process the planning team establishes  to track the plans implementation progress and to inform the  plan update. The plan must include a description of the method  and schedule for monitoring, evaluating, and updating it within  a 5-year cycle. These procedures help to:  Ensure that the mitigation strategy is implemented  according to the plan.  Provide the foundation for an ongoing mitigation program  in your community.   Standardize long-term monitoring of hazard-related  activities.  Integrate mitigation principles into community officials  daily job responsibilities and department roles.  Maintain momentum through continued engagement and  accountability in the plans progress. Plan updates provide the opportunity to consider  how well the procedures established in the previously  approved plan worked and revise them as needed.  ", "1255": "Monitoring Implementation Plan monitoring means tracking the implementation of the plan over time. The plan must identify how, when, and  by whom the plan will be monitored. For example, the plan may describe a monitoring system for tracking the  status of the identified mitigation actions and reporting this information on a quarterly basis. The responsible agency  assigned to each mitigation action may be responsible for tracking and reporting on each of their actions. Appendix  A includes an example worksheet for reporting progress on a mitigation action (see Worksheet 7.1).  The planning team must identify the lead position or agency, usually the same individual or agency leading the  plans development, for coordinating the monitoring process. A method and schedule for regular monitoring can  include reports or other deliverables and expectations for meeting attendance. Monitoring, therefore, becomes part  of the regular administrative function of the offices or positions to which it is assigned", "1256": "Updating the Plan Updating means reviewing and revising the plan at least once every 5 years to reflect changes in development,  progress in local mitigation efforts, and changes in priorities. The planning team must identify how, when, and by  whom the plan will be updated. Documenting the procedures for updating the plan requires an explanation of who  will be responsible for updating the plan and when and how this process will be initiated. The plan must include  the title of the individual or name of the department or agency responsible for leading the updating effort. It may  be appropriate to include a schedule of activities that allows sufficient time to obtain funding for and complete the  planning process before the plan expires.  The planning team can also establish procedures for updating the plan following a disaster event or concurrent with  the development of a recovery or post-disaster redevelopment plan. Your communitys vulnerabilities and mitigation  priorities often change following a disaster, and additional funding sources may become available, such as FEMAs  Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or Public Assistance. Generally, public awareness increases, and the demand and  support for mitigation frequently increases following a disaster. You may choose to take advantage of opportunities  to incorporate mitigation into recovery strategies and to rebuild wisely and safely to avoid similar losses in the  future. This is also an important time to collect data on the hazard and its impacts for future plan updates. If you are  considering developing a recovery plan prior to a disaster, coordinating the recovery and mitigation planning efforts  promotes messages about building resilience.  ", "1257": "Continue Public Involvement Keeping the plan current also means continuing to provide  opportunities for public involvement in the plan and its  implementation. Task 3 describes this requirement and offers  suggestions for continuing outreach to the public and other  stakeholders during plan maintenance and implementation. You  may choose to document how the community will continue  public participation during the plan maintenance process, along  with the procedures for monitoring, evaluating, and updating  the plan. The planning team also may identify specific procedures for  keeping elected officials involved, either through the monitoring and evaluation procedures and/or through the  process for continuing public participation. The local governing body usually adopts the plan, so reporting back  to them annually or at other regular intervals can help maintain support and provide accountability for those  responsible for the plans maintenance and implementation.", "1258": "Local Plan Review When you have completed a final draft of the plan, the planning team can publicize the mitigation plan and ask  stakeholders and the public to review and submit comments for the planning teams final consideration. Task 3   Create an Outreach Strategy describes how the public must be given the opportunity to review and comment on the  mitigation plan prior to its adoption. Suggestions for how to meet this requirement are also described in more  detail in Task 3. A good approach provides the public sufficient time to comment and explains how comments will  be used.  You may also directly inform certain stakeholders of the plans availability for comment, such as through an email  or letter. This is a particularly good approach for providing neighboring jurisdictions an opportunity to review the  mitigation plan. The plan itself can include information on the types of comments received and how comments  were incorporated. Prior to submitting the plan to the State Hazard Mitigation Officer (SHMO), the planning team may validate that  the local mitigation plan meets all requirements of Title 44 Code of Regulations (CFR) 201.6. FEMA uses the Local  Mitigation Plan Review Tool to ensure that approved local mitigation plans meet these requirements. The planning team  may view the Regulation Checklist portion of the Plan Review Tool and fill in the page numbers where your plan  meets each of the required elements. This can serve as a final internal review to confirm the plan meets Federal  requirements prior to submitting it for approval. Appendix B provides a copy of the Local Mitigation Plan Review Tool.", "1259": "Submitting the Plan Once the planning team is confident the plan meets the  required elements and includes all supporting documentation,  forward the plan to your SHMO or State Mitigation Planner.  It is critical that all supporting documentation related to  the planning process and other components of the plan are  included in the initial submittal. Incomplete plan submittals  can delay plan approval. The State will review the plan and work  with you on any required revisions for approval. Dont forget  to provide your local contact information where you can be  reached for any questions. Once the State is satisfied that the plan meets the requirements,  the SHMO will forward the plan to the FEMA Regional Office  for review and approval. FEMA will conduct its review within  45 days, if possible, and provide a completed Local Mitigation  Plan Review Tool to the State. The FEMA Regional Office and  the State may contact you to discuss additional revisions to the Figure 8.1: Plan approval process8-2 Local Mitigation Planning Handbook Task 8 Review and Adopt the Plan plan to ensure that it meets the Federal regulation. Once FEMA determines the plan meets the regulation, FEMA will  notify the SHMO that the plan is approvable pending adoption (APA), or approved if the community has already  adopted the mitigation plan.", "1260": "Approvable Pending Adoption To avoid repeated attempts to adopt the plan prior to FEMA approval, many communities obtain a notice from FEMA  that the plan is APA before adopting the plan. As a time-saving measure, communities are encouraged to submit  the final draft of the mitigation plan to the State and FEMA for review prior to formal adoption by the elected  officials or other authorized governing body. If FEMA determines the plan is not approvable and requires revisions,  the community will be able to make revisions before initiating the plan adoption process, therefore avoiding  unnecessary delays in plan approval.", "1261": "Plan Approval Upon receiving the record of adoption from the State, FEMA will issue an official approval letter stating which  jurisdictions have adopted and are approved and eligible for FEMA Hazard Mitigation Assistance programs. The  approval letter will include the expiration date 5 years from the date of the letter. Attached to the approval letter will  be a final Local Mitigation Plan Review Tool that provides feedback on the strengths of the plan, recommendations  for plan improvements during future plan updates, and suggestions for implementing the mitigation strategy.  ", "1262": "Local Adoption of the Plan Adoption by the local governing body demonstrates the  communitys commitment to implementing the mitigation  strategy and authorizes responsible agencies to execute their  actions. The final plan is not approved until the community  adopts the plan and FEMA receives documentation of formal  adoption by the governing body of the jurisdiction(s)  requesting approval. The governing bodies are typically the  Town Board, City Council, County Commissioners, and/ or Board of Selectmen. While plan adoption usually occurs  through a formal resolution, council minutes, consent agendas,  or other forms of adoption are acceptable if allowed by local  law. Appendix A includes an example of a local adoption  resolution (see Worksheet 8.1).  Each jurisdiction submits documentation of adoption to the State, who is responsible for forwarding this on to the  FEMA Regional Office. If you choose to use the APA process, adoption must take place within 1 year of receipt of  FEMAs APA notification.", "1263": "Multi-Jurisdictional Adoption Each jurisdiction seeking plan approval must adopt the plan. If  you choose to use the APA process, it is important to coordinate  the adoptions of all the jurisdictions as soon as the plan receives  APA status. The governing bodies may have different meeting  schedules, which prevent all the jurisdictions from adopting at  the same time. If possible, coordinate the adoptions and submit  documentation to the State at the same time.  Element E1 The plan shall include documentation  that the plan has been formally adopted  by the governing body of the jurisdiction  requesting approval of the plan (e.g.,  City Council, County commissioner, Tribal  Council).  44 CFR 201.6(c)(5) Element E2 For multi-jurisdictional plans, each  jurisdiction requesting approval of the plan  must document that it has been formally  adopted. 44 CFR 201.6(c)(5)8-3 Task 8 Review and Adopt the Plan At least one of the participating jurisdictions must adopt the plan within 1 year of FEMAs APA notice. FEMA  will issue an official approval letter stating which jurisdictions have adopted the plan and are eligible for FEMA  hazard mitigation assistance programs. The plan will expire 5 years from the date of FEMAs approval letter for the  mitigation plan. The approval letter and date are generated with the first jurisdiction adopting the plan. The plan  approval date remains the same regardless of when other participating jurisdictions adopt the plan. It is important  to coordinate the adoption process to ensure that all participants are covered by the plan for the full 5 years. Plan  updates follow the same adoption process", "1264": "Use the Post-Disaster Window of Opportunity The post-disaster recovery period offers unique opportunities  to accomplish mitigation goals. Public support and political  will to change policies and invest in long-term risk reduction  may be at its highest. In addition, funding sources may become  available for mitigation, such as FEMAs Hazard Mitigation  Grant Program (HMGP) and Public Assistance (PA) Section 406  funding described in the Funding and Resources section that follows.  A strong mitigation plan can help your community be prepared  to take advantage of the funding and resources. Incorporation  of mitigation strategies into either a pre-disaster or post-disaster  recovery plan reinforces the linkage of long-term risk reduction  and community resilience.  In a post-disaster environment, significant reinvestments  in infrastructure and development are often made during a  relatively short timeframe. The mitigation plan can help guide  those efforts to create a community that is more resilient to  future disasters. Here are some questions to consider and take  full advantage of the post-disaster window of opportunity for mitigation:   How can disaster funds be used to implement actions in the mitigation strategy?   How can the planning team take advantage of the publics risk awareness due to the disaster events?   How can the disaster effects influence future land use decisions to work toward mitigation goals?   What local mitigation capabilities need to be strengthened based on lessons learned?  Post-disaster implementation also presents challenges. Local priorities may be limited to building back quickly,  rather than safely, or communities may face strained capacity or capability as local officials address other post- disaster priorities. Increased mitigation funding and technical assistance from State and Federal sources after a  disaster can help offset these challenges. The recovery process should ensure that mitigation priorities, as outlined in  the plan, are actively applied to reinvestment decisions.  ", "1265": "Focus on Quality over Quantity  As you move forward with transitioning from plan development to plan implementation, it is important to achieve  a few early wins, or successfully complete some initial mitigation actions. These could be low-cost actions that can  be implemented quickly or a single high-priority project. Demonstrating progress can go a long way in gaining the  support needed to implement more complex actions in the future.", "1266": "Encourage Local Champions Successful projects often involve a strong local champion.  Champions are leaders who understand the mitigation vision,  can clearly communicate it, and can engage others to get buy- in. Spreading out the responsibility for mitigation activities to  a variety of champions increases the likelihood of a successful  mitigation program. Enlist the support of external partners  that can provide additional leverage for promoting projects,  including local businesses and other stakeholders.", "1267": "Identify a Mentor Community officials can learn from other communities that  have successfully implemented mitigation actions.

Avoid the often difficult, ad hoc process of post-disaster discovery of new roles, resources, and roadblocks.  Gain support from whole-community partnerships necessary to support individuals, businesses, and organizations.  Improve stakeholder and disaster survivor involvement after the disaster through a definition of outreach resources and two-way communication methods the local government and key organizations will employ.  Maximize Federal, State, private-sector, and nongovernmental dollars through early and more defined local priorities and post-disaster planning activity.  Provide for more rapid and effective access to Federal and State resources through better understanding of funding resources and requirements ahead of time.  Enable local leadership to bring to bear all capability and more easily identify gaps through a coordination structure and defined roles.  Better leverage and apply limited State and nongovernment resources when there is no Federal disaster declaration.  Maximize opportunities to build resilience and risk reduction into all aspects of rebuilding.  Speed identification of local recovery needs and resources and ultimately reduce costs and disruption that result from chaotic, ad hoc, or inefficient allocation of resources.  Improve capability and continuity through pre- identification of when, where, and how the local government will employ and seek support for post-disaster planning, city operations, recovery management, and technical assistance.

Using a step-by-step discussion of the planning process, this guide introduces  principles underlying preparedness and recovery planning, describes topics to be considered as part of the  planning process, and identifies specific organization-building and planning activities. Achieving fundamental recovery preparedness, involves application of six standard planning process steps  as well as several associated key recovery activities. The key activities are intended to serve as additional  considerations that expand on the overarching six planning steps, as illustrated in the graphic below, and  focus more specifically on the challenges and unique partnerships necessary for successful pre-disaster  recovery planning. In the following chapters this guide provides guidance for applying these steps and  activities in a scalable fashion in large to small communities. The planning process introduced and discussed in this guide directly aligns with the process outlined in  Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans: Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 (CPG 101). This guide is  formatted to follow the six steps of CPG 101 and presents six standard planning steps in Chapters 7 through  12 and then presents key recommended activities that are specific to pre-disaster recovery planning efforts.  Figure 1 can help to serve as a basic orienting checklist for preparing for recovery.", "1292": "AUDIENCE The primary target audiences for this guide are local government officials and planners taking an active  role in organizing or managing the development of a recovery plan. Their titles can vary from  community to community but generally include community, economic, urban or emergency  management planners; key departmental staff and officials such as housing departments or authorities; and city managers. Secondary audiences include organizations that represent key stakeholders in the  community, such as disability, cutural, social services or other interest groups. These secondary  audiences might also include local partners who have responsibility, oversight, or authority (formal or  informal) to manage resources, policies, programs, infrastructure, and institutions significant to the  recovery process. Successful planning for recovery requires participation by local government and community leaders,  officials, organizations, and individuals who are able and ready to take responsibility for shaping the  future of their community. Additionally, government and community leaders who are involved in pre- disaster recovery planning should have the ability to encourage participation from all segments of the  community. While this guide is more extensive than that needed for leadership, a key role of the planner  will be to take key materials and concepts in this guide to educate and inspire community leaders to  support the development and implementation of the recovery planning. The tools and resources  accompanying this guide located at www.fema.gov/plan will include an overview for use with  community leadership Regional or county level agencies, councils or commissions may also be a potential audience. This guide  acknowledges that some communities have more capacity and capability to address pre-disaster recovery  preparation than others do. While the primary responsibility for the planning process is at the local level,  emphasis is placed on identifying partners and resource providers able to collaborate with or supplement  local capacity. A regional or multi-jurisdictional effort may be appropriate where resources are more  limited", "1293": "RECOVERY ACTIVITIES ARE LOCALLY DRIVEN First and foremost, recovery planning should be driven by the community. The NDRF emphasizes, as one  of its nine principles, the concept and importance of local leadership and local primacy. Local governments,  businesses, NGOs, and their community members in particular have the primary responsibility for  many recovery decisions, investments, and actions. Therefore, local governments serve in the lead role in  planning for and managing many aspects of community recovery. Local recovery organizational structure  must have a direct nexus with local government. Local input is also needed by State, tribal, and Federal  partners so that they can design programs and policies to meet local needs.11 In some cases, it may be difficult for the community to take on significant responsibility for the recovery  process because of lack of capacity, resources, staff, or other factors. External partners may need to support  recovery planning, outreach, communication, and implementation activities. However, this support must  still be guided by community leaders, the local government, and a broad range of community stakeholders.  Care must be taken to ensure that support is applied where necessary, beginning immediately after disaster  strikes and continuing through challenging redevelopment decisions.", "1294": "RECOVERY ACTIVITIES ARE LOCALLY DRIVEN First and foremost, recovery planning should be driven by the community.

Participation of all parts of  the community strengthens the planning process  and facilitates an equitable implementation after  a disaster strikes. Broad participation is especially  important because buy-in from community  members and organizations is strengthened by  an inclusive process. Recovery planning must  also involve stakeholders and elements of local  government not typically involved in emergency  planning, including economic development,  housing advocates and homeless organizations,  insurance companies, lenders, apartment owners  associations, environmental and historic preservation  stakeholders, and many others. Inclusion is necessary  to ensure that all aspects of a community are  considered.", "1296": "As emphasized in the U.S. Department of Justices An ADA Guide for Local  Governments, 14 recovery planning, both before and after a disaster, must  include people with disabilities and others with access and functional  needs from the beginning to prevent delays or exclusion in post-disaster  recovery efforts. For example, affected populations may need to relocate,  and including these stakeholders in pre- and post-disaster planning  processes helps to better integrate their needs into plans and recovery  actions. Maximum efforts should be made to ensure that community  members whose involvement has historically been low are encouraged  to participate. Youth, for example, can often convey the preparedness  message more strongly than others in the community. Emphasis should  also be placed on including seniors, individuals with disabilities, and  others with access and functional needs15; those from religious, racial,  and ethnically diverse backgrounds; and people with limited English  proficiency. To ensure full and meaningful participation, there must  be physical, programmatic, and communication access for all those  potentially affected by a disaster.", "1297": "Partnerships with regional, State, tribal, and Federal agencies and  organizations are important for recovery planning and post-disaster recovery because disasters can stress  even the most prepared or equipped local community, and partnerships offer a multitude of mutually  beneficial resources. Mutual aid agreements between local governments, councils of governments, tribes,  and regional planning entities are one way partnerships can help alleviate the burden of recovery. Others  include technical assistance from universities, financial assistance from NGOs and charitable organizations,  various other assistance from existing long-term recovery groups, and volunteer assistance from Volunteer  Organizations Active in Disasters (VOAD).", "1298": "Partnerships with regional, State, tribal, and Federal agencies and  organizations are important for recovery planning and post-disaster recovery because disasters can stress  even the most prepared or equipped local community, and partnerships offer a multitude of mutually  beneficial resources.

Hazard mitigation plans, comprehensive plans, housing plans, and other  planning documents can define a wide range of goals for the community and represent shared priorities  of community members. Linking recovery planning to build on the communitys existing plans helps  inform recovery planning efforts and capitalize on past planning efforts so as not to reinvent the wheel.  Additionally, linking recovery planning with other applicable planning processes helps to incorporate  community perspectives. Recovery activities can then in turn be used to inform revisions to the  communitys other plans. Including the whole community in the pre-disaster recovery planning process  means including all sectors of the community. Many existing Federal programs relate to disaster recovery. While many of these programs are voluntary for  communities, the requirements for participation could benefit communities when they develop their pre- disaster recovery plan. For example, the Economic Development Administration requires communities to  produce Community Economic Development Strategies, and the Department of Health and Human Services  has preparedness requirements for communities that relate to disaster recovery. A pre-disaster recovery  planning process would build upon these existing efforts.  Figure 2 outlines the relationship between existing plans, like those mentioned above, and the pre-disaster  recovery plan. In addition, the figure explains how these existing plans and the pre-disaster recovery plan  are used after a disaster to support the development of post-disaster recovery plans, policies, and projects.", "1301": "RECOVERY PLANNING IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH HAZARD MITIGATION A key goal of both hazard mitigation and recovery is increasing resilience, defined in the National Preparedness  Goal as the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due  to emergencies. Although these two activities differ in many respects, this shared objective of increased  resilience allows mitigation and recovery planning to reinforce one another and leverage greater benefits  within the development of plans, and programs or projects. Because both mitigation and recovery planning  can be carried out pre-disaster, there is generally ample time to coordinate activities and promote more  widespread attention to resilience. Recovery planning can support hazard mitigation and resilience building  by providing a post-disaster mechanism for implementation and integration into the roles, processes,  and decisions that occur in the complex recovery environment. Additionally, much of the analysis and  information involved in the development of mitigation plans can be used to inform the pre-disaster  recovery planning effort. (Note that while recovery planning can support hazard mitigation, the intent of  the pre-disaster recovery planning process is not to add to the communitys mitigation plan.) The pre-disaster recovery planning process benefits from and builds on hazard mitigation as:  The mitigation planning process identifies local  hazards, risks, exposure, and vulnerability;  Implementation of mitigation policies and  strategies reduce the likelihood or degree of  disaster-related damage, decreasing demand on  resources post-disaster;   The process identifies potential solutions to  future anticipated community problems; and  Mitigation activities increase public awareness of  the need for disaster preparedness. Pre-disaster planning efforts also increase resilience  by:  Establishing partnerships, organizational  structures, communication resources, and access  to resources that promote a more rapid and  inclusive recovery process;  Describing how hazard mitigation underlies all  considerations for reinvestment;  Laying out a process for implementing activities  that will increase resilience; and  Increasing awareness of resilience as an  important consideration in all community activities.", "1302": "A key goal of both hazard mitigation and recovery is increasing resilience, defined in the National Preparedness  Goal as the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due  to emergencies.", "1303": "RECOVERY PLANNING IS GOAL ORIENTED Thorough, comprehensive, and community-supported pre-disaster recovery plans allow a locality to  more easily and effectively begin the recovery process immediately after a disaster. The development and  documentation of recovery planning goals, including the partnerships necessary to achieve those goals,  help recovery stakeholders understand existing capabilities and gaps. Equally important is the development  of realistic goals. Although a community may have its own resources or partner resources at its disposal,  the resources available to recover effectively are finite. Goal development in both the pre-disaster and  post-disaster environments needs to account for the availability of resources so that they may be leveraged  strategically to achieve desired outcomes. Appendix F includes a template that can be used to document  existing capabilities as they relate to recovery goals and the partnerships and resources in place (or not  currently in place) to achieve those goals.  In addition to determining capability gaps, using a goal-oriented process for pre-disaster recovery planning  helps to build consensus among the involved stakeholders. Establishing common, mutually agreeable,  strategic goals early in the planning process reduces conflicts when the plan is implemented in a post- disaster setting.", "1304": "RECOVERY PLANNING IS SCALABLE Recovery plan components should be scaled to meet both the capacity of the community to manage its own  recovery process and the level of risk the community faces. Communities that have minimal resources to  manage recovery but many vulnerabilities and risks will want to emphasize partnership-building in the  planning process and seek assistance from State or regional bodies. Communities with a high capacity to  manage recovery will want to emphasize local roles and responsibilities in facilitating the recovery process  and may be in a position to develop a robust recovery plan. Pre-disaster recovery plan components such as recovery goals and policies, administrative structure, and  activation of personnel (see Appendix E) will vary depending on the capacity of the community and the  partnerships needed or already in place. Operational guidance included in the pre-disaster recovery plan  should also consider the different phases of disaster management, transition from or coordination with  response coordination structures, and identify times when recovery operations peak and when they begin  to wind down. An example of a scalable recovery system is shown in Figure 3.", "1305": " Designating a point-person for recovery planning (ideally, someone who understands both emergency management and community planning)", "1306": " Identifying vital facilities that, if damaged or destroyed, would have the strongest consequences to the community (e.g., facilities used by the public, facilities that serve critical economic functions)", "1307": " Developing a public engagement strategy that is inclusive of the entire communitys population (this also includes determining the best ways to communicate)", "1308": " Identifying existing recovery stakeholders (local agencies or organizations that would be critical to facilitate the recovery process after a disaster)  Identifying outside partnerships to build resilience (State agencies or other organizations that have resources to support local recovery after a disaster)", "1309": " Identifying training programs that could help build the communitys capacity to plan for recovery (these may include training offered by the State or independent study courses offered by the Emergency Management Institute)", "1310": " Identifying key post-disaster responsibilities of local government and officials, not only for immediate rebuilding, such as permitting requirements, but also for establishing a post-disaster strategy for interim and long-term recovery", "1311": " Developing recovery priorities based on existing plans and initiatives already in place (assessing known planning goals that should be incorporated into recovery planning)", "1312": " Establishing a Local Disaster Recovery Manager (LDRM) position, office, and/or set of functions", "1313": " Conducting a vulnerability analysis (determining not only which facilities are critical, but how vulnerable they are to disaster impacts and why they are vulnerable)  Conducting an assessment of recovery capacity (reviewing resources available to support recovery after a disaster and where there are gaps)", "1314": " Developing and adopting a recovery ordinance (a formal ordinance that describes how the community will undertake the recovery process after a disaster)  Developing a hazard mitigation plan (required by FEMA for most disaster assistance);  Developing a formal, stand-alone pre-disaster recovery plan", "1315": " Formalizing mutual aid agreements with other jurisdictions to support long-term recovery needs", "1316": " Integrating resilience strategies into economic development, housing, infrastructure improvement, historic preservation, health policies, and other regional or community programs and plans", "1317": "RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY A truly holistic recovery process must include activities that support building community resilience and  encouraging sustainable development. This concept can be implemented in recovery planning efforts  through coordination with mitigation planning. Mitigation is a sustained action eliminating or reducing  potential effects of hazards, and mitigation planning attempts to identify those hazards, reduce any impacts  from those hazards, and identify potential solutions. Thus mitigation planning, pre-disaster recovery  planning, and other types of planning have parallel perspectives with overarching recovery goals of:  Increasing the speed of community recovery;  Effectively using resources; and  Increasing opportunities for community betterment that take into account and balance all community populations, needs, and risks. A successful mitigation program and other pre-disaster planning can set the stage for a more sustainable  and resilient community by positioning the community to be able to adapt to changing conditions, identify  future natural and human-related disaster threats and hazards, and withstand and rapidly recover from  disruption due to future emergencies. By addressing potential risks and developing solutions, policies, and  action statements, communities become both more resilient and sustainable.

If the community has limited resources, it may be beneficial to  consider a multi-jurisdictional recovery plan that covers multiple towns and cities or is county-wide. This  would be particularly appropriate if the community is covered by a multi-jurisdictional hazard mitigation  plan. Regional or multi-jurisdictional planning can help establish common processes as well as facilitate  mutual aid for longer-term recovery activities. Planners need to consider the current mitigation plans and  hazard information when determining geographic scope. The geographic scope and/or multi-jurisdictional partners may need to be revisited as further hazard analysis  occurs (e.g., hazards cross boundaries, strong economic linkages may be affected). Regardless of multi- jurisdictional planning, local governments, individually, may still need to establish specific roles, policies,  requirements, and legal mechanisms but could do so within the framework of the regional or multi- jurisdictional effort. A recovery plan does not need to be lengthy, and should not duplicate, but rather complement, key  elements of recovery that are already addressed in other planning documents. Care should be taken to  identify which activities will be considered and included in the pre-disaster recovery plan and which  will not. The planning team should determine whether existing community planning documents can be  leveraged or built upon to inform recovery planning. Essential recovery information, such as policies and  requirements that support recovery, operational processes and guidelines, key people and partners and their  recovery roles, and recovery resources, may be documented in the communitys other existing planning  documents. Those elements from other planning documents should be summarized or consolidated in  the pre-disaster recovery plan and referenced appropriately. These plans applicability to recovery should  be identified in the pre-disaster recovery plan. For example, there may be certain hazard mitigation,  development, or housing priorities in other community plans that should be consulted during the recovery  period to guide disaster-specific decisions on these topics. Therefore, the pre-disaster recovery plan should  note the existence of such plans and summarize the information contained in those documents, as well as  suggest how and when those planning documents should be incorporated post-disaster.", "1332": "KEY ACTIVITY TWO: DEVELOP AND  IMPLEMENT A STAKEHOLDER AND  PARTNER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Timeline: Ongoing Key Activity Two, which aligns with Step 1 of  CPG 101, is an ongoing activity. While involving  stakeholders and partners early in the planning  process is important to ensure inclusiveness,  stakeholders and partners involved will likely change  over time. As risks, impacts, consequences, capability  gaps, and capacity are determined, additional partners will need to be identified. It is critical that  stakeholders and partners be continually evaluated and that new partners be identified and included as  needed throughout the planning process.  Using the Core Capabilities is one way to identify stakeholders and partners to engage in the pre-disaster  recovery planning process. Table 2 includes potential partners for each Core Capability. The table is not  intended to be an exhaustive list. While there are many strategies for identifying and engaging new partners, one useful approach is to  build upon existing partnerships with organizations that have already been identified and included in  the planning team. These established partner organizations likely have their own network of contacts and  organizations that provide support, in some fashion, to the recovery organization. This concept is known as  using a network of networks and is illustrated in Figure 8. Although these additional partners might not  traditionally be associated with recovery operations, they could be a vital resource to a community. Define the Scope of Stakeholder Engagement Stakeholders are those who will be involved with the work of the collaborative planning team but do not  directly serve on the team. Generally speaking, stakeholders can be anyone with an interest in the recovery  planning process. They may include local individuals and organizations or those from outside of the  community, at the county, State, or even national level. The list of stakeholders should include those with  community ties that can help with outreach, as well as those with technical knowledge associated with  addressing the key community sectors, including all of the Core Capabilities. Considering the local risk  assessment and identifying structures, facilities, and services in areas potentially affected by a disaster helps  to identify additional stakeholders. Additional stakeholders may be identified by those on the collaborative  planning team, as well as by other sources, such as community advocacy organizations. Stakeholders will be motivated to participate in the planning process for a variety of reasons, and the  collaborative planning team needs to take those reasons into account. Additionally, the planning team will  need to set expectations for stakeholder involvement and define the contribution needed from stakeholders  throughout the process.

If the community  has a hazard mitigation plan, risk assessment  information in that document should be used  as a starting point. If a hazard mitigation plan  does not exist, use guidance provided in the Local  Mitigation Planning Handbook, Task Five, to conduct a  risk assessment. In most cases, hazard mitigation  plans address only natural hazards. Planners should  consult other documents, such as Threat and Hazard  Identification and Risk Assessments (THIRAs),22 that  have been completed by States, regions, tribes, and  some communities for additional threat and hazard  information. Other risk assessment documents, such as critical infrastructure assessment plans, and current  conditions of a community should also be considered when identifying a comprehensive list of hazards.  Some planning documents may focus only on short-term impacts. The recovery planning process must  ensure that long-term impacts and consequences are considered. Plans such as regional Comprehensive  Economic Development Strategies23 provide a broader view of risks and consequences.  These existing documents provide detailed information to assist in identifying potential impacts from  threats or hazards. Reviewing these plans helps planners throughout the recovery planning process  to identify threats and hazards, and will also serve as a baseline for determining existing roles and  responsibilities, and existing policy and capability gaps. Examples of existing documents to review and  consider include: 22CPG 201 can also assist in identifying threats or risks that may not be addressed in a local mitigation plan. 23The Economic Development Administration has updated the Community Economic Development Strategies requirements to include a section on resilience and  recovery planning http://restoreyoureconomy.org/recovery/post-disaster-planning-for-economic-recovery/  Know Your Community The key to determining risks, impacts, and  consequences is to know your community and  understand what defines your communitys identity.  Using existing data that may be available in local  planning documents or from local community  organizations, identify and map all community  features, attributes, community makeup, people,  and assets (social, political, financial, infrastructure,  public and private sector, institutional, etc.).  Understanding these community features will assist  the hazard identification process and provide a  more thorough understanding of resources at the  communitys disposal.

Are additional partners, technical expertise, funding, or other resources required? How can the community address each of the Recovery Core Capabilities and any additional needs during an actual recovery process?  What are the indicators of successful recovery? How does the community define a successful recovery? For example, would a certain percentage of homes need to be rebuilt or rehabilitated? A certain percentage of businesses or schools? Would stabilized local revenues indicate successful recovery? Is an increased level of resilience or mitigation of risk a priority outcome?  How well do the other elements of local government outside emergency management fully understand the workload, activities, and needs associated with their roles in recovery?", "1364": "Evaluate Planning and Regulatory Strengths and Weaknesses Those involved in the pre-disaster recovery planning process should inventory and review current policies  and regulations that relate to recovery operations or other potential post-disaster community development  activities. Careful consideration is needed to evaluate whether these policies and regulations work to  support, or could potentially hinder, post-disaster recovery. Additionally, policies and regulations that could  potentially conflict with one another should be considered at this point.

Are there financial, staffing, or other constraints that affect the communitys ability to develop or  update policies and regulations?   What local, regional, tribal, or State policy, planning, or intergovernmental conflicts might be  significant in the event of a major disaster? Is the local policy, plan, or coordination process adequate  to address this limitation or does it conflict in a post-disaster environment? Is the magnitude of  possible rebuilding considered in these activities? Policies from other levels of government that may impact local recovery efforts (e.g., State policies) should  be referenced to ensure that local recovery can take place without violating those policies. For example,  some States are Dillon Rule States, whereby local governments can only exercise authority expressly  granted by the State. In the context of pre-disaster recovery planning, communities in Dillon Rule States  need to coordinate with State counterparts to determine responsibilities and authorities post-disaster. If  there is any doubt about the legality of a recovery action such as the development of a recovery ordinance,  local stakeholders should work with their town, city, or county attorney to de-conflict policies and  procedures.

During pre-disaster recovery  planning efforts, it is critical that partner agencies and organizations evaluate their staffing resources.  This evaluation will serve to not only identify gaps in staffing quantity or expertise, but will also identify  strengths and capacities of various partners. For example, expertise related to community development,  housing, community planning, social services, disability access, historic preservation, identifying funding  sources, grant writing, public administration, and financial management are particularly important in  developing a robust pre-disaster recovery plan. Some questions to consider when evaluating staff resources include:   What staffing resources are available to assist with the increased workload associated with recovery activities?  Does current staff have subject matter expertise necessary to undertake recovery activities, develop new programs, or organize complex long-term projects?  Do all city departments fully understand their roles in recovery and redevelopment?  What organizational structures already exist within partner organizations to manage recovery? Are there long-term recovery organizations or committees to coordinate those NGOs supporting individuals and families, to manage volunteers and donations, or to use nontraditional assets? What community leadership is available to lead recovery efforts, within local government and among external organizations?", "1366": "Evaluate Financial Strengths and Weaknesses Recovering from a disaster costs money. Partner agencies and the community as a whole must consider a  communitys normal tax base in conjunction with the post-disaster potential loss of tax base, and increased  government operational costs. The costs of recovery management and activities should be considered as  well. As financial aspects of disaster recovery are evaluated, some questions to consider include:   What current local government and NGO financial resources are available to use for potential recovery activities?  Are contingency plans available for continuity of the operation of local government and/ or NGOs over an extended period of time? Specifically, are mechanisms in place for emergency funding and procurement after a disaster?  Are financial reserves available to address potential risks? What is the ability of the local government and NGOs to apply for grants, establish lines of credit, or secure other funds needed for recovery?", "1367": "Evaluate Communication and Outreach Strengths and Weaknesses As discussed above, effective pre-disaster recovery planning is based on inclusive partnerships and  considerations of the whole community. Communication and outreach strategies are the foundation of  developing inclusive partnerships and taking a holistic approach to both pre- and post-disaster recovery  planning. Pre-disaster, local governments and their partner agencies should identify their plans and  resources available to conduct outreach. Attention should be paid to identify strategies to effectively  communicate with seniors, people with disabilities, people with access and functional needs, people with  religious, racial and ethnically diverse backgrounds, and people with limited English proficiency.  Questions for consideration when evaluating strengths and weaknesses include:  What capabilities does the community have  to involve residents and other stakeholders in  recovery planning?   What capabilities does the community have  to educate residents and other stakeholders  about the importance of recovery planning and  preparedness?   What capabilities does the community have to  communicate with community members after  a disaster and to engage them in coordinated  recovery activities?   What relationships does the community have  with organizations that can assist with recovery  planning and implementation? Information should be collected in an organized manner to help maintain a clear understanding of the  communitys capabilities. To assist with this, a Recovery Capability Documentation Template Worksheet is  provided in Appendix F. Understanding strengths and weaknesses enables the community to determine what  additional partnerships may be required, such as NGOs or other levels of government, to improve strengths  and weaknesses. The information in this section (particularly the identification of resource gaps) will assist  the planning team in identifying new partners to engage. Building partnerships is an ongoing activity that  ought to be regularly revisited to ensure maximum partnership and community engagement in the process.  ", "1368": "Determine Leadership The first major leadership decision that planners and community leadership must make is the identification  of a LDRM. The LDRM, as defined in the NDRF, organizes, coordinates, and advances recovery at the local  level. This position has both pre- and post- disaster responsibilities. The person in this position requires  knowledge of the community, relationships with other local leadership, the ability to pull a team together  to develop a long-range vision, strong communication skills, and knowledge and experience in community  planning. Additionally, an effective LDRM needs to have the following general qualities:   Authority: The ability to direct and execute  recovery. As noted in FEMAs Effective Coordination  of Recovery Resources for State, Tribal, Territorial and  Local Incidents, 27 the LDRM will need to have  the authority and influence to convene and  coordinate recovery stakeholders while  emergency managers continue with disaster  response.28 This requires support from senior  leadership for recovery. The LDRM should be  respected and recognized as a leader across as  many sectors of the community as possible.  Galveston, TX, mayor and city council preside at a city  recovery plan meeting after Hurricane Ike. 27FEMA, Effective Coordination of Recovery Resources for State, Tribal, Territorial, and Local Incidents (2015), https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/ documents/101940. 28Section 2 (Leading the Recovery Coordination Process of Effective Coordination of Recovery Resources for State, Tribal, Territorial and Local Incidents).Pre-Disaster Recovery Planning Guide for Local Governments Page 50  Accountability: Recovery leadership must be accountable to the stakeholders of the community and those that empowered them to manage recovery in the first place.  Attitude: Recovery leadership must understand that recovery is a long-term endeavor involving many stakeholders, each with their own interests, needs, opinions, and resources. Being persistent but patient in working with local stakeholders and other partners is critical to managing the recovery process.  Aptitude: The ability to think strategically over the long-term about recovery needs, the ability to be flexible in using nontraditional approaches and resources, and an understanding about how to leverage resources and bring about stakeholder consensus are all necessary in an effective LDRM. Strong leadership is critical for successful recovery, so the identification of such leadership must be a high  priority. A strong leader makes securing partnerships easier, in part because the community will be able to  demonstrate that it has put time, thought, and talent into preparing for recovery. The LDRM ought to also  have the relationships and expertise necessary to ensure that recovery activities are closely coordinated with  response and mitigation efforts. Partnerships across the various mission areas need to be made long before  a disaster.", "1369": "Develop an Organizational Structure After the LDRM has been selected, planners must  decide which agencies and organizations will serve in  lead roles and which will provide support during the  post-disaster recovery process.  Creation of a recovery management office may be  appropriate depending on the potential complexity of  the recovery or the structure of the city government.  The APA report Planning for Post-Disaster Recovery: Next  Generation provides detailed recommendations (see  pages 5759 of that report) for integrating such an  office that would focus on four objectives:  Offering a foundation for preparation of a  recovery plan that anticipates as clearly as  possible pre- and post-disaster recovery needs,  as well as short- and long-term recovery  requirements  Providing an administrative umbrella for  recovery management under which both  short-term emergency-related and long-term  development-related recovery initiatives can be coordinated  Creating an action-oriented organizational venue for kick-starting effective short-term recovery  initiatives and actions  Coordinating short-term recovery initiatives and actions with visioning, exploration of options, and  public policy making more characterized by long-term recovery for rebuilding. Examples of governmental agencies that may have a role in supporting recovery efforts include the local  planning department, regional planning organizations, environmental and historic preservation offices,  health department, department of economic development, public works, housing and community  development, department of social services, zoning and building code department, the public school  system, and area colleges and universities.30", "1370": "Create Sector-Specific Coordinator Positions In addition to leadership, other positions need to be identified in the recovery organization. These positions  should be coordinators associated with key areas of community recovery. These coordinators may be  drawn from local government staff or other recovery partners. In organizing these key areas, it is helpful  to consider aligning core roles and capabilities with key community needs. In addition to the expertise  required as part of their normal duties, coordinators would also be the primary points of contact for  recovery in that subject area and would provide updates and other situational awareness to the LDRM. The  Core Capabilities, listed below and discussed in detail above, can be used as a framework and modified to  meet the communitys situations both pre- and post-disaster.  The Importance of Drawing on Others  Expertise A local housing expert may understand affordable  and accessible housing and the need for it within  the community (e.g., affordable price ranges and  locations), while the LDRM may not have that specific  knowledge. Officials with specific expertise should  support the LDRM to ensure successful recovery.  Other organizations may also need to support recovery  by assuming leadership roles and representing their  constituents in a way that ensures that the recovery  process is inclusive and community driven.   Operational Coordination (LDRM)  Recovery Planning  Public Information  Economic Recovery  Health and Social Services  Housing Recovery  Infrastructure Systems  Natural and Cultural Resources Beyond the Core Capabilities, other categories for  sector-specific positions could include:  Individual and Family Recovery   Hazard Mitigation and Resilience  Volunteer Coordination  Children and Youth   Accessibility or ADA Coordination When assigning personnel to recovery positions,  it is important to consider and follow local  protocols and procedures; planners must consider  how appointments and assignments of staff must  take place. Recovery committee(s), stakeholder  group(s), and existing task forces or committees  can be used as appropriate when determining the  sector-specific structure that a community will  use. Communities with limited staff may want  to take a regional approach, or look to county or  regional governments for assistance in coordinating  activities.  ", "1371": "Determine Sources of Additional Resources, Technical and Administrative Support Individuals representing different sectors will support the sector-specific coordinators as subject matter  experts in their particular fields. The pre-disaster recovery planning process presents the opportunity to  identify sources of expertise in subjects including recovery planning, resource management, fundraising,  public outreach, partnership engagement, project implementation, and coordination with State, tribal, and  Federal government agencies. The identification, acquisition, and coordination of resources play a significant role in post-disaster  recovery. Resources employed to facilitate recovery may include shared information (such as data,  intelligence, and key stakeholders contacts), technical assistance, subject matter expertise, and funding  mechanisms (such as existing financial reserves, grants, and loans). Planners can also look to the Effective  Coordination of Recovery Resources for State, Tribal, Territorial, and Local Incidents guide for more detailed information  specific to recovery resource identification, management, and coordination. A lack of resource coordination  among recovery participants can lead to conflicts and inefficiencies. After recovery leadership positions and their responsibilities are determined, it is also important to identify  general administrative coordination and planning activities that occur during a recovery process. This is  a prerequisite for all other recovery planning activities and is a key component of a pre-disaster recovery  plan. Some of these administrative activities can be addressed in a recovery ordinance (Appendix D),  discussed in Key Activity Six.", "1372": "Define Recovery Operations Guidelines and Strategies After positions have been determined within the  recovery organization, operating guidelines and  strategies must be established to ensure effective  communication and coordination that will fully  meet the needs of the community. Agencies serving  in lead roles as a sector-specific coordinator need  to work with their respective supporting agencies  and partners to determine their own operational  strategies. Careful consideration of existing  statues, policies, and regulations will be required  during this phase of the planning process. Defined  guidelines and strategies vary from sector-to-sector  and from community-to-community. In a pre- disaster planning process, coming to an agreement  ahead of time about coordination mechanisms and  strategies facilitates more efficient and effective post- disaster activities.", "1373": "Develop a Process for Notifying and Engaging Recovery Partners in Preparation for or Immediately after a Disaster Creating a chain of communication and pre-determined location(s) for convening partners enables  recovery planning and implementation to be initiated in a timely manner. Use of technology for virtual  coordination and information sharing can be considered. Not every emergency will require a robust  recovery organization, which means planners need to take steps in a pre-disaster context to determine  what situations would require the recovery organization to take action. Care should be taken in this step to  clearly delineate responsibility for leading the engagement of recovery partners either in preparation for,  or immediately after a disaster has occurred. These communications must be accessible to partners with  disabilities or access and functional needs to ensure inclusiveness of the whole community.  ", "1374": "Prepare a Process for Gathering Damage Information and Assessing Impacts to Evaluate and Support Recovery Activities  through the Long-Term One of the first post-disaster recovery activities is to assess damage and gather information. While each  disaster impacts a community in a different way, steps can be taken during the pre-disaster planning  process to establish information sharing practices. Emergency managers and responders may be a source of  initial impact information immediately after a disaster has occurred. The full range of partners identified  through the planning process will assist with preparing a broader and longer-term statement of impact  needs. Sector-specific coordinators and other community leaders should identify, pre-disaster, what sorts  of information they need and how best to obtain that information. Consideration must also be given to  data collection mechanisms and long-term impact analysis. Information sharing and analysis processes  should be considered with partners from all sectors to ensure that the products can be used by all partners  involved in the recovery process.  Historic buildings and districts and other cultural  resources should be factored into pre-disaster and  post-disaster priorities.Pre-Disaster Recovery Planning Guide for Local Governments Page 56 Many options exist for information collection, analysis, and sharing; what works for one community may  not work for another. Local governments may also want to consider the use of tools and software to assist  in completing these tasks. While the specific execution of an information gathering and sharing strategy  will likely need to be addressed post-disaster, preliminary decisions can be made pre-disaster in regards to  who is responsible for data management and what partners can provide pertinent community information.", "1375": "Develop Guidelines for Recovery-Related Public Communications Coordinated messaging is a challenge in any  portion of a disaster. In recovery specifically,  information for citizens can be complex, confusing,  and even conflicting. The recovery organization  needs a defined position dedicated to ensuring  that information related to the recovery effort is  being effectively communicated to the public in  accessible formats. Specifically, the planning team  should determine who is responsible for delivering  effective public communication, how this will be  accomplished, how often, in what formats, and  for what purposes. To the extent possible, it is  important to be transparent in informing the public  so that expectations can be identified in advance,  properly addressed, and clarified. Transparency  helps to build public confidence in the recovery effort.  ", "1376": "Develop Strategies for Tracking the Needs of Individuals and Families and Connecting Them with Recovery Support Resources  (Referred to as Disaster Case Management) The primary goal of disaster recovery operations is to address the needs of survivors and communities.  Recovery planners should develop holistic, pre-disaster recovery plans and strategies, based on potential  disaster scenarios, to address both disaster-caused and pre-existing, ongoing social service and community  development needs. These plans and strategies should include a comprehensive disaster case management  process that integrates technological solutions as well as tracks and matches survivors and available  resources, develops individual disaster recovery plans, and provides referrals and advocacy services.  Whole-community recovery includes disaster case management for individual recovery and efforts to  rebuild community infrastructure. Both approaches require strong partnerships among government, local  community, NGO, and private-sector stakeholders and are key for survivor recovery. NGO-led disaster case management has been the cornerstone of recovery for more than 40 years. In 2006,  FEMA was authorized to develop and implement a disaster case management program when Congress  enacted the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, with States including Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey,  and New York implementing disaster case management under FEMA grants. Working under their own  missions, NGOs continue to provide disaster case management services to survivors and training to  practitioners.33", "1377": "Identify Strategies for Securing and Managing Financial Resources  After the evaluation of financial strengths and weaknesses in the previous Key Activity, the planning team  will need to develop strategies for filling identified financing gaps. Financial resources to consider include  both grants and low-interest loans. It is important to be aware that loans may be necessary to support  recovery, especially in cases where grants and similar funds are not available or do not fully support  recovery needs. Financial resources are not only needed for individuals and families, but for businesses  and various sectors of the government as well. Many potential post-disaster funding sources can be pre- identified", "1378": "Identify Strategies and Processes for Engaging with State-Level Recovery Structure and Variety of State, Tribal, and Federal  Agencies Most States have a recovery leadership and coordination structure that addresses the recovery Core  Capabilities. Some States may have a structure that includes a function for assistance to and outreach to local  recovery entities and organizations. During pre-disaster recovery planning, the mechanism for coordinating  with external partners, such as State government agencies and departments, and Federal resources, should  be identified. Local governments may elect to have a position within the local recovery organization that  works directly with the State or may choose to have State and local resources that work in similar functional  areas collaborate directly. The pre-disaster recovery plan should also identify existing relationships between  local departments and State and Federal agencies, and ought to identify strategies for leveraging and  coordinating those relationships in a post-disaster environment. These relationships, as well as the strategies  for engagement that are identified pre-disaster vary greatly among local communities.  ", "1379": "KEY ACTIVITY SIX: ESTABLISH PROCESSES FOR POST-DISASTER DECISION-MAKING  AND POLICY SETTING Timeline: Months 3 to 9 In addition to establishing an effective organizational structure with all of the necessary agencies and  partners, stakeholders and participants in recovery must also establish leadership principles and a decision- making process. Similar to Key Activity Five, the decisions that relate to post-disaster decision-making  processes and priority-setting should be made using CPG 101 Step 4 as a guide. With likely threats and hazards in mind, the pre-disaster recovery planning team will need to determine  what goals, priorities, and policies can be established prior to a potential disaster. While priorities for  short-, intermediate-, and long-term recovery established pre-disaster are ideal in helping to facilitate and  inform post-disaster decision-making, the impacts of a disaster vary, and therefore some decisions, policies,  and procedures will be made in the midst of the recovery process. For example, understanding that much  of the community is in a flood zone allows local officials to begin thinking about a relocation plan. The  considerations and decisions related to recovery from a flood are very different from the decisions made in  the wake of an earthquake. However, in both cases, if baseline priorities for leadership addressing short-,  intermediate-, and long-term recovery have been established pre-disaster, the outcomes for the impacted  community will be improved.  Planners must determine a process for making decisions post-disaster. As recovery needs are identified,  there must be a process for making decisions to address those needs. Establishing this decision-making  process guides leadership in allocating limited resources. As the decision-making process is developed  during this Key Activity, it will be helpful to organize decisions through a process that:  Evaluates the conditions and needs after a disaster  Sets recovery goals and objectives  Measures progress against those goals and objectives as well as the process, protocol, and policy concerning recovery funding  Ensures there is sufficient input on recovery priorities from key stakeholders and makes sure that stakeholder outreach is linked to post-disaster decision-making (i.e., the process to involve key stakeholders pre-disaster is reflected in the post-disaster process) The processes for enacting post-disaster recovery policies or ordinances should also be established during  pre-disaster recovery planning. Even before a disaster, a person with the responsibility for enacting policies  (including considerations for when policies ought to be enacted and for how long) can be identified.  Disaster recovery may require that certain authorities and policies be in place to initiate and expedite  recovery activities. This helps to compensate for losses in government capacity or significant challenges and  choices after a disaster.  ", "1380": "The planning team must determine which policies may need to be altered post-disaster to address recovery  needs. Examples of potential policies include expedited zoning and building code compliance review for  rebuilding and expedited procurement or hiring policies. Ordinance language can then be developed to  implement these policies. When drafting policy language, it is important to consider State statutory laws  or authorities that may invalidate or limit the proposed changes. It is also essential to understand the  local governments post-disaster responsibilities under an adopted Floodplain Management Ordinance for  communities participating in the NFIP. Roles and responsibilities for those who would be responsible for overseeing these policies also need to  be established pre-disaster. For example, local governments need to determine who would be responsible  for overseeing expediting zoning review and what authorities they must be granted to accomplish their  assignments. Policies should be drafted to ensure that recovery participants will have the authority needed  to execute their responsibilities. Formalizing authority legitimizes the pre-disaster recovery plan and  indicates commitment by local leadership. Authority and responsibility of designated recovery leaders  should also be clearly defined. This step can be accomplished by developing a recovery ordinance, which  grants the recovery organization the authority to implement recovery planning activities after a disaster  strikes. For more information about how to develop an ordinance, see Appendix D of this guide. Finally, formal approval must be obtained by the governing body for policies and ordinances that have been  developed.

The  plan must be concise and clearly communicate  the decisions made by the pre-disaster recovery  planning team to operators, partners, and the  public in an accessible format. The plan ultimately  provides a framework for action, accounting for  known pre-disaster issues and resource gaps, and  addresses leadership, partners, priorities, and  polices for recovery.

Public outreach may be accomplished  through a variety of means, including advertising through traditional media outlets, such as newspapers  and radio, and through other nontraditional outreach, including organizational bulletins and social media  websites, such as Facebook and Twitter. Many communities have used social media as one means of public outreach. While there may be a legal  obligation to use traditional media, supplementing those kinds of outreach efforts with nontraditional  outlets helps ensure that the overall outreach effort is as inclusive as possible. The plan should be made  available by various means (including printed and electronic versions) and in formats accessible to  those with communication access needs. A short summary of the plan and/or plan topics should also be  developed as the plan is finalized to serve as a quick reference. Notification to the community about this review process may include traditional means, including print  media, as well as nontraditional means, such as social media or other online forums. Public outreach  should be used to determine accessibility needs. Furthermore, planners must be sure to consider the use  of appropriate auxiliary aids and services (e.g., interpreters, captioning, alternate format).

The final Key Activity (which aligns with Step  6 of CPG 101) is vital to ensure that the plan remains a useful document for the community and to ensure  that stakeholders are prepared to implement the plan if necessary.  Establish Which Agency or Committee is Responsible for Overseeing Ongoing Preparedness Activities Having collaborative recovery planning team members oversee ongoing activities provides a stable and  consistent means for enabling the communitys continuous understanding of the recovery plans and the  steps and resources available to follow the plan. Adopting formal procedures and policies to govern ongoing  preparedness activities will provide a framework for standardization of and consistency in subsequent  recovery actions undertaken. Ideally, one of the agencies on the planning team is designated to manage and  monitor preparedness activities related to the plan.  Undertake Regular Activities to Increase Preparedness To maximize understanding and build capacity in the recovery process, communities should establish  a regular schedule of training, exercises, and document review, revision, and update. This will enable  planners to address outstanding capability or process gaps, mitigation needs, and other preparedness needs.  Recovery planfocused exercises should be integrated into other community preparedness activities. The  recovery plan should be discussed along with any activity associated with other planning projects that  already have built-in public involvement, such as the comprehensive plan, hazard mitigation plan, or  economic development strategies. Additionally, considerations for recovery operations (guided by the pre- disaster recovery plan) should be included in exercises of the emergency response plans for the community.", "1385": "Test Pre-Disaster Planning, Preparation, and Staff Capabilities through Recovery Exercises Recovery exercises are drills used to test execution of recovery operations. Exercises involve developing  hypothetical disaster scenarios and asking the recovery organization and other partners to consider the  community ability to implement recovery under those circumstances. This process enables evaluation of  the plan, aides the community in understanding its role in recovery preparedness and plan implementation,  and helps identify gaps in policies, roles, partners, resources, and procedures. When testing the pre-disaster recovery plan, it is important to consider unanticipated challenges that could  hamper the community while addressing a disaster. For example:  The building permit office does not have enough staff to manage the increased permitting workload. How will the locality increase the permitting capacity to meet post-disaster demands and support rebuilding efforts?

This reevaluation may occur in conjunction with other planning updates, such as:  The comprehensive planning process involves evaluating changes in local demographics, the economy, and other local conditions, which pre-disaster recovery planning should take into account.  Local mitigation plans are required to be reviewed and updated at least once every 5 years; updating the pre-disaster recovery plan on the same schedule allows it to include up-to-date risk assessment information. Stakeholders, partners, and the public should be regularly invited to comment on the plan, provide their  concerns and suggestions for revision/updates, and participate in exercises. Regular evaluation and review may require a process for the receipt of notifications of necessary or  proposed changes with respect to other State, county, and/or local statutes, rules and regulations. This may  also include notifications of proposed and effected budgetary changes to agencies and programs that are a  part of the plan.", "1387": "Evaluate New Vulnerabilities Characteristics of a community may change  over time, which means that planners must  regularly reevaluate the threats, hazards, and  vulnerabilities of their community. Vulnerabilities  could be physical, environmental, cultural, or  geographic elements of a community that could  be risk prone, or policies that could inhibit the  ability of a community to recover from a disaster.  They could also be the result of a new hazard or  new information about an existing hazard. Pre- disaster recovery planners need to work closely,  and regularly, with hazard mitigation experts to  research and understand changing community  vulnerabilities. Hazard mitigation is a fundamental  cornerstone of preparedness, and opportunities  to mitigate should be considered and utilized.  Planners must also consider new community  vulnerabilities that arise from changes in policy at  the local, State, tribal, and Federal levels that could  impact the pre-disaster recovery plan. Regardless of  how new vulnerabilities are identified, many of the  previous Key Activities will need to be repeated to  ensure the validity of any decisions that were made  during the planning process.", "1388": "Document Best Practices and Lessons Learned  As the final activity in developing a pre-disaster  recovery plan, the collaborative planning team  should document the steps that were followed in  the planning process. No two jurisdictions conduct  their planning process in exactly the same way, so it  is important that planners take the time to document  best practices and lessons learned. Analysis of the  planning process and defined areas for improvement  in future planning efforts benefit the community  and partner communities as well.

By planning, prioritizing, and  acting, communities can improve their resilience over time, in a cost-effective manner that is consistent with their  long-term resilience goals. If a disruptive event does occur, communities with resilience plans will be ready to respond, recover, and build  back better  if rebuilding is necessary. Communities that plan and carry out resilience strategies will be better prepared for future events, making the  community more attractive to businesses and residents alike.", "1391": "This Playbook is intended to help communities  more easily use the Guide and improve community  resilience planning by addressing:  The importance of connecting social and  economic goals and services to the built  environment (i.e., buildings and infrastructure  systems or community lifelines).

It offers an approach to help  communities integrate all of their community plans  through community resilience planning and goals. The Guide emphasizes the importance of  interdependencies across the built environment,  which includes buildings and infrastructure systems   especially those providing transportation, energy,  communications, and water and wastewater services. The built environment supports vital social and economic  functions such as shelter, food, education, healthcare, business and government. Community services and functions  need to recover as quickly as possible, preferably within a specified period of time set by each community.  When recovery of key services and functions is delayed, community residents  face increasing challenges to remaining in the community.

To more ably recover from hazard events by thinking through their goals, priorities, and current strengths and  vulnerabilities, and asking informed questions.  To accrue benefits of new investments and improvements in community spaces and infrastructure, even if a  hazard event does not occur in the near future.  To take advantage of the fact that resilience planning is most effective prior to a hazard event.  To integrate well-developed resilience goals into other planning documents so that they will be better  positioned to address opportunities to advance their resilience goals.  To improve eligibility for funding from federal agencies (e.g., FEMA, HUD, EDA) and other sources.", "1394": "mprovements to community resilience do not occur  overnight and some priorities could take years or  decades to fully be achieved. Still, meaningful progress  can be made in shorter time frames. And there are  always low-hanging options that can be considered  once a community agrees on goals and directions.  Thats especially true if community resilience goals are  integrated into all community plans.  The Guide encourages users to obtain input and support  from public and private community stakeholders   local government as well as individuals, community  organizations, and service providers  to address  recovery as well as hazard preparedness, response,  mitigation, and adaptation goals. The Guide also helps  communities review their current situation, including  threats and vulnerabilities, and to identify performance  goals and gaps in the performance of buildings and  infrastructure. Then it assists communities in prioritizing  and addressing those gaps through resilience goals and  planning at the community scale.  All communities are encouraged to conduct the  first three steps in the Guide. That will enable them  to advance beyond the status quo by bringing key  stakeholders together (Step 1), characterizing the  communitys current social and economic needs as  well as its built environment (Step 2), and generating  performance goals and gaps for building clusters  to meet community functions and services (Step 3).  Just asking the questions and considering the issues  necessary to get to this point in the process can prove  useful for communities exploring or embarking on the  Guides process. The Guide process has two types of performance that  are evaluated for buildings and infrastructure systems: desired performance goals and anticipated performance.  Desired performance goals are specified by the community in terms of time to recover functions for systems that  are essential to the community and its recovery. It is important to note that desired performance goals are hazard  agnostic because the need for community services and functions does not vary by hazard event. The anticipated  performance is an assessment of the time to recover function performance expected for existing community systems  if a hazard event occurred tomorrow. The difference between the desired performance (for all hazard events being  considered) and the anticipated performance (for specified hazard events) identifies gaps that can negatively affect  community recovery and long-term resilience. Step 4 helps turn a communitys enhanced understanding of how its social and economic functions rely upon the  built environment and its interdependencies into a plan for moving ahead. After completing step 4, communities are  strongly encouraged to move on to Step 5 (Plan Preparation, Review and Approval) and Step 6 (Plan Implementation  and Maintenance).

It  can assist communities seeking insights into resilience planning issues and help identify the most effective resilience- COMMUNITY RESILIENCE & HAZARD  MITIGATION PLANNING  As of March 2020, 25,300 local jurisdictions in the U.S.  have developed hazard mitigation plans to reduce risk  from natural hazards and to ensure their eligibility for  FEMAs Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grant Program.  Hazard mitigation is considered to be sustained action  taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to human  life and property from hazards. The range of actions in  hazard mitigation plans are similar to and complement  those addressed in local plans and regulations that  influence land use and development patterns, structure  and infrastructure projects, natural systems protection,  and education and awareness programs. Communities  may use their hazard mitigation plan as a starting point  for developing a community resilience plan. Planning for community resilience emphasizes  connecting mitigation and recovery phases  of preparedness, but also includes response,  protection, and prevention. Community resilience  involves understanding how communities and their  members social and economic activities rely on the  interconnected elements of the built environment and  ensuring the communitys goals for recovery of function  of social and economic activities drive the prioritization  and selection of risk-reducing activities. These activities  span a range of constructed and administrative  solutions (including those within a hazard mitigation  plan).

Deciding on the scope of the resilience  planning effort will play a big role in determining its success. Determining the scope of the community resilience plan is key to defining success and setting expectations for  community engagement and implementation of the plan  and ensures adequate representation on the planning  team. The scope should consider factors such as what elements of the built environment will be included (e.g.,  government buildings and facilities, privately owned facilities) and associated stakeholders, and social and economic  functions supported by the selected infrastructure. It also should take into account the users or stakeholders who rely  on the services provided by these facilities. Considerations for the planning team could include:  Prevailing hazards and chronic stressors. A FEMA hazard mitigation plan approach may provide a list of  natural hazards for consideration. The team can leverage the information from the FEMA-approved mitigation  plan and should decide whether it will address one or multiple prevailing hazards, or perhaps chronic stressors  like increasing temperatures. The team may determine that certain hazards are out of scope because they  are unlikely or because their potential impact might be so great that they are impractical to plan for from the  standpoint of recovery.   The elements of the built environment. The team may decide to address government-owned buildings  for the first phase of its resilience planning effort. Considering this smaller subset may be easier for the team,  but there are trade-offs  including the more limited view of resilience and implications for the communitys  ability to deal with and recover from a hazard event. The planning team should consider if privately owned  and managed elements of the built environment (e.g., electrical infrastructure) should be included to ensure  relevant private sector organizations input are solicited (related to Action 1-4). In any case, if a community is  conducting resilience planning while updating their hazard mitigation plan for FEMA, they may need to include  all buildings and infrastructure systems deemed critical by the community.

Dont surprise anyone!  Continuous community engagement: Continuous and active community outreach and engagement   via workshops, briefings, collaborative online dialogues and tools, or focus groups  should be conducted  throughout the planning and implementation process.  Coordinator for community engagement: Appointing a team member to coordinate stakeholder  engagement will help ensure representative inclusion of varied views. External or public affairs officers may be  well positioned to serve in this role.  Data management and sharing: When needed, a cooperative arrangement with private stakeholders  that addresses concerns about information exchange and security for resilience planning can improve  collaboration and access to critical information.

They should consider different kinds of  vulnerabilities and the needs of the entire population  remembering that all parts of the community are likely  vulnerable in some ways. This helps the team to spot potential gaps in services, as well as to link vital services to  relevant infrastructure and buildings. Template 1-1, Table 1-5 suggests potential members of a social dimensions task  group.  RESILIENCE SCORECARD HELPS COMMUNITIES INTEGRATE PLANS (ACTION 2-1) The Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard (PIRS) method is helping communities to integrate all their plans   like those for transportation, parks, economic development, hazard mitigation, emergency management and  comprehensive land use  so that the plans work together to reduce vulnerability to hazards. For instance, a  citys hazard mitigation plan may call for acquisitions and buy-outs in high-hazard areas, while its comprehensive  land use plan may set goals to increase investments in the same location. Such plans are not only incompatible,  but actively increase vulnerability. PIRS, developed by the Institute for Sustainable Communities at Texas A&M  University, walks users through a process that (1) evaluates community plans with respect to hazard risk and  how well they target areas of the community that are most vulnerable, (2) identifies when and where those plans  are in conflict, and (3) resolves those conflicts across plans to reduce hazard vulnerability.17 Actions 2-2 to 2-5 describe the steps of information collection necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding  of the connection between the communitys social dimensions and its built environment.", "1422": "Action 2-2: Characterize community members and their needs. The planning team should  collect information that provides a data-informed perspective on the communitys population and  contextual factors, including demographic, social, and economic factors that are important to  the communitys residents, organizations, and businesses. Community members present and future needs can be informed with data on population demographics, economic  indicators, social vulnerabilities, and social capital. Demographic information can include age, health, education,  income, employment, housing status, language, cultural background, and vulnerable populations (e.g., those with  medical needs, low income households, non-English speaking populations, and individuals with limited mobility). Links  for publicly available data to characterize the population are listed in Guide Brief 1  Characterize the Population.  Understanding a communitys vulnerable populations needs, expectations, and reliance upon various community  social functions leads to a more inclusive, comprehensive, and respectful resilience planning process. Communities  should determine the needs of its most vulnerable populations, including those who may be underrepresented in  government decision-making organizations, and ensure their perspectives and needs are reflected in resilience efforts  and projects. This information will be especially useful in Step 4  Plan Development. These vulnerable populations  may have differing needs and require unique solutions.", "1423": "Data and input on community demographics and needs may be obtained from research centers, chambers of  commerce, regional planning organizations, consulting firms, institutes of higher learning, faith-based institutions, and  other organizations with data and/or analysis capabilities.

The planning team should characterize the  built environment  buildings and infrastructure systems  that community services and functions  rely upon. Dependencies between buildings and infrastructure systems should also be identified. A communitys built environment is foundational to community functions, services, and the variety of daily activities of  its residents. The built environment includes, but is not limited to:   Buildings (e.g., critical, commercial, industrial, residential)   Transportation facilities (e.g., roads, tunnels, rail, airports, maritime ports)  Energy systems (e.g., electric power, fuel systems)   Communication systems (e.g., internet, phone, cellular)  Water and wastewater systems (e.g., reservoirs, pumping stations, transmission network, water treatment  plants, storm water system, wastewater treatment)  Typical information collected for individual buildings and infrastructure systems includes ownership, location, current  use, size, age, construction type, zoning, current condition (e.g., maintenance, retrofits, or upgrades)  along  with applicable codes, standards, and regulations at the time of design. Information on current conditions and  dependencies on other buildings or infrastructure systems is also necessary to understand functional connections.  This information will contribute to understanding how the built environment is expected to perform if one or more of  the systems, or a segment of a system, stops providing services (e.g., energy services). Infrastructure data may be  collected by public agencies or departments, regional planning commissions or metropolitan planning organizations,  or utilities  or they may be found in local plans (e.g., comprehensive plans, hazard mitigation plans) or GIS databases. Some communities draw upon standing service provider councils or establish them as part of their resilience  planning initiatives to define interdependencies among infrastructure systems and to develop compatible performance  goals and solutions. Additionally, community growth may have strained infrastructure capacity and the council can  provide input on future needs. Related to risk levels, overlaying spatial hazard information with infrastructure locations using GIS-based maps can  help communities understand whether their buildings or infrastructure systems are located in higher-risk areas. For  instance, many communities and key installations were established before flood zones were mapped or updated;  consequently, buildings and infrastructure systems may be subject to flood damage. Other communities have  buildings and infrastructure systems located in liquefaction zones and may not perform well if a significant seismic  event occurs.  One way to help identify and prioritize buildings and infrastructure systems is to ask for community feedback on the  question: What institutions and services are most important to you? Institutions and services often require more than  one building and can be addressed through building clusters that support functional categories oriented around types  of services provided. This information can help the planning team understand how elements of the built environment  work together to provide services before and after hazard events and will be used in Step 3. Further, functionality of  buildings and building clusters can be used to assess the value of alternative resilience projects, instead of relying  solely upon replacement value of an asset. For example:  Health care clusters: Hospitals and acute care facilities/services are under Critical Medical. Medical  provider offices are addressed under the Community Recovery functional category. Other health services,  such as pharmacies, dialysis clinics, and treatment centers should also be included where they are most likely  to be located.   Business clusters: A large employer may be placed in the Housing/Neighborhoods functional category  under the Critical Retail building cluster. For instance, building and infrastructure repairs may be needed for  short-term recovery. Other businesses may be placed under the Housing/Neighborhoods/Businesses or  Community Recovery functional categories. Banks and ATMs, gas stations, and supermarkets are examples  of other facilities/services that need to be considered for placement.

The planning team should identify  links between social functions and the buildings and infrastructure systems that support them for  day-to-day operations and during a recovery process. Informed by these links, building clusters  and supporting infrastructure should be defined by how they support social functions. Once the social dimensions and built environment are characterized, social functions can be linked to their support by  buildings and infrastructure systems. This requires fact-finding and coordination among planning team members and  stakeholders.  Table 2-2 offers examples of links between various social institutions and transportation systems, as well as possible  direct and indirect impacts of transportation system damage. The Guide provides similar tables (Guide Tables 10-6  through 10-8) for other infrastructure systems that can assist planners understanding and identifying these linkages.

The planning team should identify long-term  community goals that will inform or be affected by community resilience plans. Identifying community-level goals will assist in developing resilience strategies so that prioritized investments in  buildings and infrastructure will also promote the communitys ability to prepare for anticipated hazards, adapt  to changing conditions, and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions. In some cases, this approach might  find ways to achieve community goals not previously considered but would result in greater social, economic, and  resilience benefits. Community goals may already be identified or defined in a comprehensive or general plan, land-use plan, pre-disaster  recovery plan, hazard mitigation plan, and/or capital investment budget. Long-term community goals may go beyond  resilience planning but will be improved by including resilience. For example:  To attract new business investment, a community may wish to develop more resilient physical infrastructure,  such as increasing redundancy or diversity in transportation options  like an additional bridge to provide a  second access point for traffic to the downtown area or an industrial park.  To increase its social well-being and equity, a community may want to develop parks that also act as basins  for flood waters or it may seek to improve transportation access to underserved areas.  A community may need to improve the performance of its water or wastewater treatment plants to minimize  disruption of service and meet environmental requirements (e.g., reduce the risk of damage during hazard  events).  A community may want to diversify its economy with increased sources from a range of sectors and markets  to encourage positive economic growth and development.  A communitys population growth and its projected demands on healthcare institutions may call for expanded  health facilities that will also be functional immediately following a hazard event.", "1430": "Action 3-2: Determine desired performance goals for  buildings and infrastructure systems. The planning team  should determine specified times for recovery of functions or  services provided by building clusters and/or infrastructure  systems, with input from owners, operators, and other key  stakeholders. Long-term community goals should inform specific community resilience goals.  The desired performance goals are expressed as recovery times and should  build on the social and economic characteristics and needs of the community  from Step 2. For example:  The desired performance for critical facilities, such as emergency rooms and 911 call centers, is typically  continuous service or minimal disruption after a hazard event.   Most residents should be able to shelter in their homes or in emergency housing after a hazard event, and  utility services should be restored in a maximum of one or two weeks to keep residents in the community.   Small businesses and major employers need to resume within one-to-two weeks to maintain the economy;  schools and daycare need to have similar goals for resuming operations so all parents can work.   In contrast, it may be reasonable to set recovery times for non-emergency city services at weeks or months,  such as parks and recreation facilities. The desired recovery time between a hazard event and the recovery of community functions and services is  independent of the type of hazard. For instance, the desired recovery time for a hospital or utility will be the same for a  range of hazards (e.g., flood, hurricane, earthquake). This is because community needs are likely to be the same for  recovery of functions following any hazard event; the actual performance that is anticipated for a specific hazard event  (defined in Action 3-3) is evaluated separately in Action 3-4.", "1431": "The planning team should address questions that get to the heart of resilience requirements and help identify the  desired performance goals (see Boulder County Resilient Design Performance Standard) for the community, such as:   When and how much do the buildings and infrastructure systems supporting each business or institution  need to recover their intended functions and services?  What timeframe for recovery is needed for housing, schools, and businesses before the communitys ability to  serve its members is adversely affected?   Where is it reasonable to use temporary measures until repairs can be completed?  These kinds of resilience questions should be a critical focus for the planning team.  ", "1432": "Each community is different. For example, a performing arts center might not be critical in one mid-sized city; for a  smaller community where the center attracts tourists and is a primary supporter of downtown businesses, a shorter  recovery time may be strongly desired. For other communities, a manufacturing plant that is crucial to the countrys  military supplies may be determined to be much more critical than another type of factory.

However, current practice is developed for individual projects, and  does not spell out the means or the criteria by which to consider their integrated performance at the community level.  The community perspective is provided by setting desired performance goals for building clusters and  interdependencies based on community needs. This is a core value provided by community resilience planning.", "1434": "Communities should consider human and social needs when assigning building clusters to the three recovery phases.  Table 3-1 gives an example of building clusters listed for functional categories and recovery phases. Infrastructure  systems that support the clusters are not listed but also should be considered. While three recovery phases are designated, there will be considerable overlap in their initiation and completion, as  indicated in Figure 3-1. Functional Levels for Building Clusters. The Guide recommends using three functional levels for specifying the  desired time-to-recovery performance goal for building clusters. The percentages may vary, but generally meet the  following levels of recovery:  Minimal: 30% of building cluster is functional  minimum number of facilities needed to initiate the minimum  functions and services required of a building cluster  Functional: 60% of building cluster is functional  minimum number of facilities to meet the usual operations  (functions and services) of a building cluster  Operational: 90% of building cluster is functional  minimum number of facilities needed to declare that the  building cluster is operating at normal capacity  Setting functional levels helps define how a building cluster will meet the desired performance goal while addressing  immediate response needs following a hazard event.", "1435": "Hazard occurrence vs impact. The occurrence of a hazard type and magnitude does not imply a level of impact,  such as damage and losses. The level of preparedness and resilience of a community can result in very different  outcomes. Hazard impact is a result of the consequences of a given hazard event. Two measures are used in the Guide to  indicate the anticipated consequences:   Affected area may be a portion of a community (local), most or all of the community (community), or across  the community and surrounding communities (regional).  Level of disruption to community functions may be handled within normal operations (minor), require activation  of community/state emergency response assistance (moderate), or require activation of federal emergency  response assistance (severe).  Hazard impacts are identified in Table 3-1 in the sub-table labeled Disturbance which lists the hazard and anticipated  impact levels.", "1436": "DETERMINE ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE Action 3-4: Determine the anticipated performance of buildings and infrastructure  systems. For each hazard event of interest, the planning team should determine the time to  recovery of community functions, accounting for dependencies and varying rates of recovery. This action considers how the communitys current building clusters and infrastructure systems would fare in a  potential hazard event that occurs in the near future. The estimate of performance, based on the current condition of  the built environment as characterized in Step 2, is referred to as the anticipated performance. The question being  addressed is: how long will it take to recover community functions for a hazard event given the current state of the  built environment and the estimated level of damage and loss? The anticipated recovery times are then compared to  the desired performance goals, also expressed as recovery times.", "1437": "Most buildings and infrastructure systems in service today were designed to serve their intended functions on a daily  basis under normal environmental conditions and routine hazard events. In addition, buildings and other structures are  designed to provide occupant safety during a design hazard event, but they may not continue to be functional.  Lack of experience with a damaging hazard event, and lack of understanding about the level of damage to be  expected when a significant hazard event occurs, can lead to misconceptions about a communitys vulnerability.  Communities can gain better insights into their vulnerabilities based on national experience, not just local events, and  can better address those vulnerabilities by adopting and enforcing land use guidelines and national model building  codes. The cost of compliance for new construction is often minimal compared to the cost of recovery and  reconstruction.", "1438": "There are multiple options for determining anticipated performance:  Expert Judgement: Estimate anticipated performance using expert judgment of the team, stakeholders, and  other experts as needed.  Past Hazard Experience: Estimate anticipated performance using data from past hazard events similar  to the hazard event being analyzed, taking into account changes to codes and new construction that have  occurred in the interim.   System-Level Assessment: Use performance assessments previously conducted for buildings or  infrastructure systems.  Building or Community-Level Assessment: Commission technical experts to assess anticipated  performance using available technical tools. The HAZUS modeling tool, for example, is commonly used to  assess the impact of earthquake, flooding, hurricane (wind and storm surge), and tsunami events on buildings  at a community scale. Current engineering practice for predicting the performance of buildings and infrastructure systems under specific  hazard events often is based on expert judgment or the past experience of other communities. For more detail, Guide  Chapters 12 through 16 provide considerations for estimating the performance of existing buildings and infrastructure  systems. Guide Brief 4 and Guide Brief 4A offer additional guidance on determining anticipated performance of the  built environment. Using the Guide Templates. The anticipated performance  time to operational recovery levels  needs to be  determined for buildings clusters and infrastructure systems and documented in Template 3-1 and Template 3-2 with the desired performance goals. It is important to include interdependencies between buildings and infrastructure  systems when determining anticipated, or expected, recovery levels. For example, an educational building cluster   all K-12 schools, administrative buildings, bus facilities, and maintenance facilities  requires buildings, power, water  and wastewater, and communications to be functional, and transportation routes for staff and students to reach the  facilities.", "1439": "SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS Action 3-5: Summarize the results. The planning team should document the desired  performance goals and anticipated performance of existing buildings and infrastructure  systems by integrating the results from individual performance tables for building clusters and  infrastructure systems.

Based on the information gathered and developed in Steps 1 to 3, the gaps between desired and anticipated  performance can be identified, including contributing factors and impacts or consequences for the community. The  gaps should be prioritized in terms of their importance in advancing the communitys resilience goals.  The planning team should also determine if performance gaps are addressed by ongoing or planned projects. For  example, plans to improve the stormwater system may not be as important to a communitys overall resilience as a  need for a second road or bridge to provide redundancy for emergency access or community evacuation during flood  or fire events. Consideration of the impacts and consequences of these projects toward community resilience goals   while taking available resources into account  will help inform the decision process. Community resilience priorities need to be considered alongside many competing needs and interests.

That may  include new projects and mitigation projects (e.g., barriers, relocation, improvements, renovations).  New projects can be tailored to meet the community resilience goals for immediate and long-term needs. Mitigation  projects can help reduce damage from hazard events and support long-term resilience strategies. Both new and  mitigation projects can also reduce demands during recovery and speed the overall recovery process.  Construction solutions usually require capital improvement budget authority and may take considerable time to  complete the approval process. However, planned construction projects with resilience benefits often produce a list  of shovel ready projects that better position the community for funding opportunities by private sources or federal  agencies. This can include short-term or temporary solutions, such as modular or manufactured housing, to meet  immediate needs as well as longer-term projects, such as new or relocated developments, to improve community  resilience. Importantly, after a hazard event, construction solutions should be informed by the community resilience plan and  its goals for performance of buildings and infrastructure systems. This may include reducing or removing the hazard  (e.g., increasing elevation, relocation for flood events) and supporting infrastructure requirements (e.g., new utilities  for relocated development). Regardless of the approach taken, the key is to be thoughtful, innovative, inclusive, and  open-minded about creating the right mix of affordable solutions that will match community priorities and available  resources.  The potential construction solutions (see the textbox for Action 4-2b) may require long-term planning and capital  investment. Each community has differing capacities for capital investment.

All new projects and substantial  improvements should assess risks to climate change hazards in the context of  the projects purpose, asset type, site location, and funding, and then determine  the appropriate resilient design strategies using the Guidelines. The Guidelines  apply to all City capital projects except coastal protection projects (e.g. sea walls,  bulkheads, and levees), for which the City is developing separate guidance.  Implementing the Guidelines will result in designs that will make City facilities  more resilient to climate change and promote the health, safety, and prosperity  of New Yorkers.  The primary goal of the Guidelines is to incorporate forward-looking climate change data in the design of all City capital  projects. Codes and standards that regulate the design of facilities already incorporate historic weather data to determine  how to design for todays conditions. However, historic data does not accurately represent the projected severity and  frequency of future storms, sea level rise, heat waves, and precipitation. The climate is already changing and will  continue to change in significant ways over the full useful life of facilities designed today, threatening to undermine capital  investments and impede critical services if they are not designed to future conditions. The Guidelines complement the  use of historic data in existing codes and standards by providing a consistent methodology for engineers, architects,  landscape architects, and planners to design facilities that are resilient to changing climate conditions (see Figure 1).

For example, resilient design  choices should be made as an integral part of the Citys project planning, risk management, and financial planning.  Similarly, resilient design choices should be selected to maximize the efficacy and efficiency of investments. Some  ways this can be done include: 1) integrating soft resiliency strategies (operational measures or investments in green  infrastructure) and hard resiliency strategies (built or intensive investments); 2) addressing multiple climate hazards with  single interventions; and 3) reducing climate change risk in concert with other goals (e.g., energy efficiency or reduction in  greenhouse gas emissions).", "1478": "Climate Change in New York City The New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) provides regional climate change projections that inform  City resiliency policy. Composed of leading scientists, the NPCCs projections for the metropolitan region show  that extreme weather will increase in frequency and severity, and that the climate will become more variable.  These projections are divided across future time slices including the 2020s, 2050s, 2080s, and 2100. The  2015 NPCC climate change projections (which were reassessed and validated in 2019) encompass a range of  possible outcomes, for example:  Mean annual temperature is projected to rise by 4.1 to 6.6F by the 2050s, and by 5.3 to 10.3F by  the 2080s.4  Frequency of heat waves is projected to triple by the 2050s to 5 to 7 heat waves per year and 5 to 8 heat  waves per year by the 2080s.5  Mean annual precipitation is projected to increase between 4 to 13% by the 2050s, and by 5 to 19% by  the 2080s.6   Sea level is expected to keep rising by 11 to 21 inches by the 2050s, and by 18 to 39 inches by the 2080s.7 For more information on climate change projections for the metropolitan region, see Appendix 2. As the NPCC  continues to study and refine projections, the Guidelines will be updated as needed to reflect changes in the  scientific consensus.  ", "1479": "A resilient facility is one built to withstand, or recover quickly from, natural hazards, as well as to perform to its  design standard throughout its useful life in a changing climate. To meet this goal, facilities should be designed  to withstand climate conditions projected for the end of the facilitys useful life.8  Full useful life represents the  extended service life of a facility (assuming regular maintenance). Some new facilities built today, including  some buildings, may have an extended useful life beyond the values listed after undergoing substantial  improvements. Therefore, this list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Project teams should utilize professional  judgment to determine the useful lives of the facility and components in design.  Climate change projections for NYC, as defined by the NPCC, are broken into decadal projections. In the  Guidelines, the following decadal projections are associated with specific time spans:  2020s projection = present to 2039  2050s projection = 2040 to 2059  2080s projection = 2070 to 2099  2100 projection = end of century and beyond", "1480": "Throughout the Guidelines, particular actions are recommended depending on the criticality and/or the size of  a capital project. These two distinctions are summarized below: Criticality: Some facilities or components are classified as critical either because of the services they  provide (e.g., hospitals and key transportation assets) or their importance during an emergency (e.g.,  designated shelters and back-up energy generators). This classification determines levels of freeboard in the  sea level rise-adjustment section. See Table 3 in Section II.C for a full list of critical facilities for the application  of the Guidelines.  In complex facilities with multiple components, whether or not the full facility is considered critical, designers  should identify critical components. Critical components essential to the facilitys functionality should be  protected to the higher standard provided even if the facility itself is non-critical. For example, at a non-critical  vehicle maintenance yard, some components are critical to the functioning of the site, such as an emergency  generator. Critical component protection should also be evaluated if a facility is expected to be fully operational  during extreme weather, or if it is expected to quickly resume full operations after an event. Some examples of  critical components include:   boilers,   chemical feed equipment,   communications systems,   electrical distribution and switching areas,  elevators,  emergency fuel supplies,   emergency generators,   fire alarms and suppression equipment,   furnaces,   hazardous material storage,   HVAC units,   monitoring and safety equipment, and  motor-control centers.

Major projects are recommended to receive additional analysis  to ensure that all risks are identified and mitigated in a cost-effective manner. It is recommended that major  projects should perform a thorough climate risk assessment and full benefit-cost analysis (see Section III).  However, some projects with a total cost over $50 million may not require additional analysis if, for example,  the majority of costs relate to restoring natural areas or green space.

However, as with all projections, there is uncertainty  embedded within them.9  The NPCC continues to  develop, review, and synthesize the latest climate data  for the metropolitan region, and new findings will be  incorporated into future versions of these Guidelines.  Given uncertainty, flexible adaptation pathways provide  a useful, iterative approach for managing uncertainty  and designing resilient facilities, particularly those with  a useful life that extends past 2050 - beyond which  the uncertainty of projections increases.10 Adaptation  pathways are particularly useful for expensive, long- lived, and highly complex facilities. They provide a way  to balance uncertainty with cost, as well as manage  operational and maintenance constraints. A facility can  be engineered with an adaptable protection level which  reduces risk to acceptable levels for part of its useful life  and can be re-evaluated as risk levels change.  Figure 2 illustrates a flexible adaptation pathway for a  critical facility component: an emergency generator with  an approximate useful life of 25 years located outside of  a non-critical building. The Guidelines recommend that  the foundation of the generator structure is designed to  match the useful life of the adjacent building, which is  built to the 2080s projections. Assuming the generator  is at risk from sea level rise and coastal surge, it should  be built on an elevated concrete slab that matches the  future year design flood elevation (DFE) corresponding  to the end of the generators useful life. The generator must be replaced when it reaches the end of its useful  life, which is less than that of the adjacent building. When the replacement generator is installed, the concrete  slab is further elevated to accommodate the future DFE. The foundation of the generator and the columns are  designed to support the additional future load from the elevated concrete slab. This initial investment allows for  future flexibility and avoided costs. Adaptation pathways may not apply equally to all types of projects or climate change projections. Flood  defenses, for example, may more easily incorporate an adaptation pathway than heat-vulnerable materials or  below-grade drainage systems. For this reason, the Guidelines conservatively use the middle of the 25th to  75th percentile range projections for sea level rise and the high-end 90th percentile projections for heat and  precipitation. For precipitation, the Guidelines use existing 50-year storm data as a proxy for the projected high- end 5-year storm (see Section II.B and Figure 5 for more details). Uncertainty can be further addressed through additional analysis, including a full climate change risk  assessment (see Section III for a methodology).

Determining what loads are critical and how long  they should be powered for is essential for a facilitys operations and what the role of the facility will  have in an emergency situation.31  Depending on the size of the critical load and budget, different backup power supply options could  range from backup generators (e.g., diesel, natural gas) to hybrid systems (e.g., solar with battery  storage and an appropriately sized generator). Each option has different trade-offs that should be  considered in terms of cost, feasibility, and environmental impacts. For shorter duration needs and/or  smaller critical loads, buildings with existing solar systems should consider adding storage to provide a  resiliency benefit. In some cases, co-generation systems may be most appropriate, especially if there  is a significant heating and/or cooling load in addition to electricity demand.32  Depending on the backup option, assess the need to invest in internal electricity rewiring and  building energy management systems. Options include installing switches; reconfiguring distribution  infrastructure to isolate critical loads from non-critical loads; installing equipment to make it possible  to island system from the broader grid during larger disruption; providing software and hardware to  manage the deployment of hybrid systems; setting up external hookups for temporary generators and  boilers.33", "1499": " Failure in facility ventilation, electrical, and air conditioning systems: some systems designed to meet  the requirements of existing standards may overheat and fail during future extreme events.

Step 2: Define Impact Thresholds  Define the magnitude and type of impact for each relevant climate hazard that would need to occur to sig- nificantly hinder site operations, and the type of disruptions or damages one would expect. Before reviewing  specific impacts to the project it is important to understand the types of conditions that can have a detrimental  effect on the project. This can range from catastrophic events (e.g., hurricanes) to nuisance events (daily  flooding from high tide, heat amplification every afternoon in summer, etc.). Both types of events should be ex- amined. These events or conditions will be used in Step 4 in the evaluation of various types of consequences  and will allow the design team to coordinate with any appropriate agencies and reviews consistently. Step 3: Evaluate Likelihood Evaluate a projects physical hazard exposure and useful life to determine probability of climate-related im- pacts occurring over the projects lifetime and account for the way extreme heat, precipitation, and sea level  rise manifest over the project useful life. Exposure is a factor of the projects physical location, taking into ac- count the areas geographic susceptibility to extreme events or environmental change. Likelihood is the proba- bility of hazardous climate-related impacts occurring over the projects lifetime, and increases with the length of  a projects useful life. A likelihood rating is based on the projects physical hazard exposure and useful life, and  will help agencies understand how the threat posed by each climate hazard changes over time. For example,  a project with a useful life ending in 2100 is more likely to experience extreme events or conditions, such as  a 1% annual chance storm, than a project that has a useful life ending in 2030, and would therefore receive a  higher likelihood rating. Likelihood is rated on a tiered qualitative scale of nearly certain to rare. Step 4: Estimate Consequences Consequences come in many forms and are a product of the value and sensitivity of the exposed asset. Es- timate the potential damage, disruption, or strain to project assets and components, as well as to dependent  sectors and the surrounding community, that would result if a climate impact were to occur. Assess conse- III. ToolkitNYC Mayors Office of Recovery and Resiliency Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines - Version 3.0 34 quence regardless of the likelihood of occurrence. For example, if the first floor of a building were inundated  for several days due to a coastal storm, the consequence of this flooding would be the same irrespective of  its likelihood. Consequence ratings rely on users technical and institutional knowledge of the sensitivity of the  projects internal and external systems to climate impacts, and of the potential severity of the hazard occurring. Step 5: Summarize Risk Assess a projects risk to all climate hazards using the likelihood and consequence rating scores generated in  Steps 3 and 4. Summarize the results and identify notable trends. The results of Steps 3 and 4 can be summa- rized and compared using a risk matrix, like the example below.

This section provides benefit-cost analysis (BCA)  methodologies and tools to calculate and compare the incremental costs of using the Guidelines with the  incremental benefits. These resources will aid in making decisions when selecting between various resilient  design strategies. The main guiding principle in the development of the BCA methodologies included here was to balance  simplicity with accuracy. However, types of benefits can vary by climate hazard and by the type of facility;  benefit categories identified here may not cover all the potential benefits provided by every facility type within  New York City. In particular, the benefits of planning for increased precipitation are difficult to quantify and the  project design team should incorporate additional data as new inputs become available.  For projects with construction costs below $50 million, the project team is recommended to perform a  qualitative benefits assessment on the interventions that meet the Guidelines recommendations for all  applicable climate hazards.

Direct benefits include reduced or avoided physical damages to facilities and contents, reduced or avoided  displacements for residential structures, and reduced life cycle or O&M costs that can be quantified as a  primary result of implementing a specific hazard mitigation measure. Table 12 in Appendix 5 provides a list  of direct benefits and basic guidance on estimating and documenting values for sea level rise and increased  precipitation-related flood hazards. Note that given the current state of practice, it is not possible to quantify  reduced or avoided physical damages or residential displacements that result from specific extreme heat  mitigation measures. Therefore, direct benefits applicable to extreme heat hazards are limited to reduced  life cycle costs applicable to certain measures, such as green roofs (refer to Table 15 for more details).   Indirect benefits include reduced or avoided service losses for non-residential buildings, public facilities,  and/or infrastructure (e.g., utilities, roads, and bridges) based on the value of service continuity and/ or emergency services to New Yorkers that can be quantified as a secondary result of implementing a  specific hazard mitigation measure. Table 13 in Appendix 5 provides a list of indirect benefits and basic  guidance on estimating and documenting values for sea level rise and increased precipitation-related flood  hazards. Note that given the current state of practice on extreme heat, it is not possible to quantify reduced  or avoided service losses that result from specific extreme heat mitigation measures. Therefore, indirect  benefits applicable to extreme heat hazards are limited to reduced energy costs such as cool roofs, green  roofs, shade trees, and so on (refer to Table 15 in Appendix 5 for more).  Other benefits can include social benefits for residents such as avoided stress and anxiety, avoided lost  productivity, environmental/ecosystem service benefits, avoided need for emergency services, and other  potential benefits.

It is assumed that the project design team will develop  alternatives to address each of the following applicable climate hazards - sea level rise/coastal storm surge,  increased precipitation and extreme heat - separately.  This assessment allows agencies to screen the qualitative benefits for various alternatives that would then  lead to development of final project components to match the available budget and goals of the project.

See Table 6 for an example of how to complete the template. The template can be customized to meet project  goals and objectives.  During the qualitative assessment, the project design team should assess how intervention strategies will  have varying levels of reliability, effectiveness, benefits, and cost implications.

This approach aligns with FEMAs approach of using social  and environmental benefit categories when calculating benefits and costs.

Do not be  discouraged if you fnd that many  of your policies fail to meet one  or more of the criteria upon closer  inspection. It is typical for 20%  (or more) of policies to drop out  during this step if you cast a wide  net as adviced in Policy Task 2.  Validating and preparing your  policies has several benefts. First, it  provides valuable documentation  of each policys key components  and your logical reasoning. Second,  it reduces confusion and facilitates  a smoother policy scoring process.  Third, it generates a new list  of policies excluded from the  scorecard, but are potentially  low-hanging fruit (Chapter 4).  Despite their exclusion from the  fnal scorecard, these policies  are currently part of an adopted  plan and, therefore, guiding  community development and  management. Excluded policies  represent opportunities for later  adjustments that will strengthen  plan integration and resilience in  your community. 3.1 Confrm and Assign  Directionality When reviewing a policy, frst  consider whether and how it  meets the vulnerability criterion.  If you confrm that it is likely to  positively or negatively afect  vulnerability, jot down a few  notes in the Vulnerablity column  regarding your reasoning.  Once you have confrmed the  directionality, you may fnd it  helpful to color-code your policies   in, say, green (if it is likely to have a positive efect) or red (negative  efect). If you think a policy in your list is  unlikely to afect vulnerability  or  that its efect could just as easily be  positive as negative, given the way  it is phrased  you may choose to:  move it to the low-hanging fruit list and set it aside for later consideration during a future plan revision, OR  leave the policy in the scorecard, but note its neutrality (e.g. color-code it beige or yellow). In this case, you will still spatially assign the policy during the scoring step, but will not give it an actual scoremarking it, instead, with a 0 as a place holder. As long as you are spatially assigning policies, doing so for these neutral policies will not constitute much additional work, but may prove even more valuable during a plan revision process than if you simply move them to the  low-hanging fruit list.  Whatever you decide, policies  that will likely have negative or  neutral efects on vulnerability  will be prime candidates for  adjustment (or deletion!) as you  work to improve integration  and build resilience to hazards  through wise plan and policy  guidance. 3.2 Confrm and Record  Place-specifc Term For each policy, also confrm  that it contains a place-specifc  term that will allow you to spa- tially assign it during the scoring  step. As before, writing a few  notes in the appropriate column   this time the Place-specifc Term column  will help clar- ify your thinking. Be sure that these notes contain the actual place-specifc term from the policy and, if appropriate, a brief explanation about how it ought to be spatially defned in your community. Keep in mind that you may fnd  policies that you believe are  applicable throughout the entire  hazard zone (or zones).

Making such policies more  explicitly place-specifc by adding  a place-specifc term(s) during  your plan revision process may  strengthen them and improve  your plans ability to foster greater  resilience. As an added bonus, when you  fnish this step (Policy Task 3.2) for  all of your policy lists, your notes  from the Place-specifc Term col- umn can be given to your GIS team  to help them with Map Task 4. If  they can develop a comprehen- sive set of maps/shapefles/layers  of place-specifc terms, this will  dramatically improve your ability  to spatially assign policies during  the scoring step. 3.3 Confrm and Record Policy  Tool Finally, confrm that each policy  contains an actionable policy  tool(s) and record it (them) in the  Policy Tool column, along with a  brief explanation, if needed. Use  Section 2.3 and Tables 2.4 and 2.5 to  help you decide what, if any, tool is  suggested by the policy.

If we overlay Wash- ingtons waterfront commercial  area with the hazard zones, we  see a diferent storycommer- cial investments (and plans for  even greater intensity) in areas  exposed to food hazards and", "1578": "perpetuates the negative efects of the  hazard.  A score of 0 indicates the policy is neutral and has no efect on vulnerability, whether positively or negatively, in the district-hazard zone.  Not applicable indicates that the policy does not refer to the district- hazard zone (or the policys place- specifc term is not located in the district-hazard zone). Scores for not applicable (NA) may be added to the spreadsheet to avoid confusion and enhance recognition of the spatial impact of policies on district-hazard zones. The NAs will not afect the summed index scores, and cells left empty may be confused as not yet scored. Consider blacking-out district- hazard zone cells that are NA. However, if your team is comfortable with leaving these cells blank to indicate NA, you may do so. To help you quickly and accurately score  policies, display the district-hazard zone  map with the place-specifc term layer of  the policy you are spatially assigning. If  set up in a GIS, you can easily toggle map  layers on and of for each place-specifc  term. For instance, a policy may refer to  the place-specifc term wetlands. The  next policy may refer to the place-specifc  term public housing. If you have these as  layers within your map, you can easily see  where they are locatedand within which  district-hazard zone(s). Below are several examples of policies and  explanations of their policy scores and  locations. Additional examples may be  found in Table 2.8. Using the Plan Integration for  Resilience Scorecard spreadsheet  (see Appendix C), assign each policy  in your fnal policy lists to the  appropriate district-hazard zone.  The sum of all scores assigned to  each district-hazard zone will result  in an index policy score for that  area of the community, which can  be compared and mapped (see  Chapter 3: ANALYSIS). Furthermore,  the compilation of all district- hazard zone scores results in a total  score for each planning document.  An example scorecard is shown in  Table 2.8. First, observe the way each policy  was determined to afect hazard  vulnerability. Every district-hazard  zone (cell on the spreadsheet) will  receive a score of +1, -1, 0, or  not applicable for every policy,  depending on how the policy is  likely to afect vulnerability in that  part of the community.   A score of +1 indicates that a policy positively afects (that is, it reduces) vulnerability for a specifc district-hazard zone. In other words, it reduces (directly or indirectly) the exposure of people or structures to the hazard or mitigates the negative efects of the hazard.  A score of -1 indicates that a policy negatively afects (that is, it increases) vulnerability for a specifc district-hazard zone. In other words, it increases (directly or indirectly) the exposure of people or structures to the hazard or", "1579": "EVALUATING POLICY SCORES Your completed Plan Integration for Resilience Scorecard contains a  wealth of information about your communitys network of plans and  policies, including their alignment and spatial focus and the level of  integration of hazard mitigation. By producing a PIRS, you have not  only spatially evaluated your network of plans and improved your  understanding of how policies are likely to afect vulnerability, but also  organized your data to facilitate efective comparison and visualization. Tables Tables are a simple and powerful way to display complex results, such  as those from your resilience scorecard, and to inform further analysis.  Your fnished scorecard enables the production of tables that contain  the summed values (index policy scores) for each district-hazard zone. A  useful summary table might contain lines with these summed values for  each separate plan in your network, along with a line for the composite  values (total scores across all plans). Other tables can be created  according to your analytical needsfor example, it might be useful to  create a table that indexes only the negative-scoring policies, so that you  can determine the district-hazard zones in need of the most attention.", "1580": "Maps To go a step further, you can  create choropleth maps (which  use shading or coloring to display  diferences in value) from the totals  and sub-totals in your scorecard.  If you are working in GIS, this may  be accomplished by joining your  summary table(s) to your district- hazard zone layer(s) (see Box 3.1).  Maps are an informative way to  visualize your resilience scorecard  resultswhich are, after all,  intentionally spatial! Figure 3.1c Join the Table and District Boundary using ArcGIS Figure 3.2 shows choropleth  maps for the four individual  plans in Washington, NC, while a  composite map is shown in Figure  3.3. Each district-hazard zone  score on the map corresponds  to a summed value (index policy  score) in the scorecard. Notice  that areas outside the hazard  zones are not given scores,  because they are not included in  the resilience scorecard analysis,  which is confned to parts of the  community at higher hazard risk.", "1581": "Analysis Your PIRS tables and maps  enable many diferent kinds of  evaluation. Although analysis may  be undertaken using tables alone,  maps help make the results more  intuitive and compelling, and  help with pattern identifcation.  Three useful methods of analysis  are explained below, but you are  encouraged to explore others. 1. First, we might compare diferences between hazard zones. For instance, in the CAMA Core Land Use Plan (Figure 3.2, top left map), the western-most district (District 2) is shown to have more policies focused on reducing vulnerability in the current hazard zone (100-year foodplain; hatched) than in  the future hazard zone (2100  sea-level rise; dotted). In the  same way, we can observe that  in Districts 7 and 8, the CAMA Core Land Use Plan contains  a policy mix that is likely to  reduce vulnerability in the  current hazard zones, while  the policies focused on the  future hazard zone are likely  to increase vulnerabity. These  fndings may indicate the need  for adjustments to the policies  that afect specifc district- hazard zonesa process  facilitated by the organization  of the scorecard. This step is  explained in greater detail in  Chapter 4.", "1582": "2. We might also use the tables and maps to compare policy scores across plans. In Washington, NC, the Comprehensive Plan (Figure 3.2, top right map) and the CAMA Core Land Use Plan (top left) contain policies that increase vulnerability in certain district- hazard zonesparticularly in Districts 1, 3, and 5. In contrast, the Hazard Mitigation Plan (bottom left) and Parks and Open Space Plan (bottom right) actively decrease vulnerability throughout the city, including in Districts 1, 3, and 5. This apparent inter- plan confict may require  further investigation and  reconciliation (the subject of  Chapter 4). 3. Finally, the maps can be used to identify policy hot spots  and policy cool spots in the cityareas receiving much or relatively little policiy attention, respectively, from the plans. These can be identifed for individual plans as well as for the network of plans, as a whole. For examples of hot spots, we can observe the Composite Policy Score", "1583": "Map for all plans in Washington (Figure 3.3). It is clear that several  district-hazard zones contain an overall policy mix that is likely to  increase vulnerability (areas in pink), while others contain many  policies that are likely to reduce it. These results suggest the need  to prioritize policy changes and investments in resilience measures  in parts of District 1, 5 and 8, where the greatest incongruities exist  among the plans and where vulnerability is likely to be increased.  The city might look for inspiration to District 2, where the policy mix  appears well-aligned toward reducing vulnerability. Washingtons Comprehensive Plan (Figure 3.2, top right map) provides  an examples of a cool spot. Both district-hazard zones in Districts 2,  4, and 5 display policy scores of zero. In Districts 2 and 5, this is due to  intraplan policy confictan equal number of policies likely to reduce  vulnerability as likely to increase it in these areas. In District 4, however,  it signifes the absence of policies. Washingtons Comprehensive Plan focuses more policy attention on the central, developed portion of the  community (much of it actually increasing vulnerability) than in the  outlying areas. This lack of policy attention for some hazard-prone areas  could prove problematic, and may merit further discussion (see Chapter  4). Some of the results of your policy score analysis may seem  discouragingbut dont lose sight of what the evaluation really is:  a diagnosis that reveals how various policies are pulling in diferent  directions. The path forward, toward greater community resilience, is to  adjust and adapt policies and priorities based on this new knowledge,  as will be detailed in Chapter 4. To help prioritize these adjustments  and interventions, we recommend that you also conduct vulnerability  assessments and compare the results with those from your scorecared.", "1584": "Physical vulnerability refers to  the built environment, including  buildings and infrastructure,  exposed to hazards. The location  and vulnerability of critical facilities  is of special concern.  Social vulnerability refers to  the people, households, or even  neighborhoods and communities  exposed to hazards. Physical Vulnerability The simplest way to understand  physical vulnerability is to think  about the investments that  will be impacted if a disaster  strikes. What structures  homes,  businesses, public facilities  will  need to be repaired or rebuilt?  What infrastructure  roads;  public transportation services;  stormwater drains; food control  structures; electrical, water, and  wastewater lines and facilities   will be damaged or afected? And  which of the most critical facilities  in the community  schools, fre  and police stations, hospitals,  pharmacies, grocery stores  are  exposed to hazards? Improved Parcel Value There are many ways to evaluate  physical vulnerability (and many  resources available to help  communities do sosee Box 3.3).  One straightforward strategy is  to calculate physical vulnerability  using improved parcel value data  to illustrate the diferences across  your communitys district-hazard  BOX 3.3: Why assess  physical vulnerability and  plan integration together? A recent analysis of six  coastal cities_x0012__x001A_ found an inverse  relationship between plan  integration scores and physical  vulnerabilityhigher plan  scores were correlated with  lower levels of physical  vulnerability across district- hazard zones. The analysis also  led to suggestions regarding the  value of targeting districts that  are most physically vulnerable,  and how various land use policy  tools might work together in  support of physical vulnerability  reduction. _x0012__x001A_ Berke, P.R., Malecha, M.L., Yu, S., Lee, J., & Masterson, J.H.

While not a comprehensive  indicator of physical vulnerability  (and with the notable drawback  that some appraisals may be out- of-date), improved parcel value  data are useful for several reasons: 1. All communities are required to maintain publicly available property appraisal records, making for easy access to relevant data; and 2. Improved parcel value is an accepted proxy of investments in the community. To perform this physical  vulnerability assessment, frst  gather the latest improved parcel  value data from the appraisal  records database (usually provided  by the county assessor). Also,  obtain the latest parcel boundary  shapefle with the parcel codes which should also be publicly  available. Create a GIS layer by  joining the improved parcel value  data to the parcel boundary  shapefle, using the parcel code  that is shared by both datasets.  Then, fnd the average improved  parcel value for each district.  Location of Critical Facilities Another important aspect  of physical vulnerability in a  community is the location of  critical facilities. Critical facilities  are structures and infrastructure  that are essential to the proper  functioning of a community,  especially during and immediately", "1585": "following a disaster. They  typically include hospitals, police  and fre departments, schools,  water/wastewater treatment  facilities, electrical facilities,  public transportation facilities,  and even so-called commercial  critical facilities like pharmacies  and grocery stores. The true  value of a critical facility is often  greater than its appraised value;  when a communitys electricity  is out for several days, or when a  hospital or shelter is unreachable  due to fooding, quality of life is  signifcantly afected.  Information on critical facilities is  typically collected and updated  by emergency managers as part  of the hazard mitigation planning  process. If facility locations can be  obtained, overlay them with the  scorecard and other vulnerability  maps. This will enable the  identifcation of district-hazard  zones that contain critical facilities,  adding another important element  to your analysis.  For a more comprehensive  evaluation of community critical  facilities, we suggest referring  to the Community Resilience  Planning Guide, produced by the  National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST), an agency of  the U.S. Department of Commerce.  You are also encouraged to explore  other metrics and indicators for  evaluating physical vulnerability to  decide what best suits your needs  (see Box 3.3).", "1586": "BOX 3.4 Physical Vulnerability within the HAZUS-MH  Flood Loss Tool Hazus-MH Software from FEMA provides a national database of  demographic (age, income, race etc.) and infrastructure data,  critical facilities, transportation and utility networks, and building  inventory (GBS, or general building stock).", "1587": "ocial Vulnerability Social vulnerability is a term that  emerged in the feld of disaster  research in the 1990s and is  defned as a persons or groups  capacity to anticipate, cope  with, resist and recover from the  impacts of a natural hazard. 2_x0011_ Disasters afect diferent people  or groups in diferent ways, based  on their relative vulnerability,  resulting in some populations  being more strongly afected than  others.", "1588": "Social Vulnerability Index There are a number of ways  to assess social vulnerability,  including many detailed research  methodologies and online  applications (see Box 3.6). One  well-regarded method  the Social  Vulnerability Index (SVI)  from  the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC)  will be described here. The SVI method has two key benefts: 1. Data are easy to obtain, coming from the U.S. Census Bureaus American Community Survey (ACS); and 2. Demographic information is intuitively combined to defne areas of potential need. The CDC maps social vulnerability  at multiple scales by focusing  on a series of 15 demographic  indicators, grouped into four  categories: Socioeconomic characteristics  Below poverty  Unemployed  Income  No high school diploma Household composition and  disability characteristics  Aged 65 or older  Aged 17 or younger  Civilian with a disability  Single-parent households Minority status and language  barriers  Minority  Speaks English less than well Housing and transportation  characteristics  Multi-unit structures  Mobile homes  Crowding  No vehicle  Group quarters The CDCs Social Vulnerability  Index (SVI) database (svi.cdc. gov) allows communities large  and small to access maps of  vulnerability in their local area.  Data are also available for  download. Because the CDC data  come from the U.S. Census Bureau,  communities that want to take a  closer look can download datasets  at as fne a scale as the census  block group.  We suggest that you visit the  website and download SVI data  for your community. The open  and comprehensive nature of the  download allows you to customize  your analysisyou can use all  15 indicators or focus on a few  that may be more applicable to  the context. Of course, if your  community already has data on  socially vulnerable populations  (gathered, for instance, as part of  other planning initiatives) feel free  to use that, instead!", "1589": "Analysis Figure 3.7 depicts social  vulnerability at the district scale in  Washington, NC, based on SVI data.  According to this set of indicators,  the most socially vulnerable area  in the city is District 5, just north  of the Central Business District  (District 1). District 5 is also located  in both food hazard zones, and  receives mixed direction from the  network of plans (Figures 3.2 and  3.3); some policies work to reduce  vulnerability, while others are  likely to increase it. This suggests  something of a policy-vulnerability  mismatch with respect to social  vulnerability in District 5, and a  need for higher prioritization.  Opportunities exist to increase  resilience in this highly socially  vulnerable area by adjusting  existing policies and incorporating  hazard mitigation and social equity  more efectively in plans and  policy initiatives (see Chapter 4).

The process  of amending plans and policies  should ideally also be informed a  comprehensive community en- gagement efort (see Advancing  Knowledge section, below). By  prioritizing policy hot/cool spots,  vulnerability hot spots, and areas of  policy-vulnerability mismatch  but  also remembering to look compre- hensively across your community  and network of plans  you can ad- just, add, expand, or even remove  policies to improve plan alignment  and reduce vulnerability.  Using the information gathered,  scrutinize your scorecard, focus- ing on areas of concern, but also  thinking about policies that might  have a broad impact. Take the time  to consider policy alternatives,  including those that might be  added or amended with minimal  efort, cost, or opposition. Work  with internal staf and elected and  appointed ofcials to develop and  prioritize policy changes, informed  by feedback from stakeholder  groups (again, see below). Develop  a phased action plan with time- lines to address priorities, which  can help guide legislative changes  and facilitate greater plan integra- tion when updating existing plans  or drafting new ones. Actions may  include:   Adjusting policies within ex- isting plans (see Examples of Policy Adjustment, below)  Amending development reg- ulations and other ordinances (e.g. subdivision or zoning or- dinances)  Undertaking a new resilience planning process, such as that described in the NIST Commu- nity Resilience Planning Guide For controversial or harder-to-im- plement changes, discuss alterna- tive strategies with ofcials. There  is no easy answer for communities  that desire economic investment  in hazardous areas. Return-on-in- vestment and other mechanisms  may be used to facilitate decision- making.

Rectifying instances of inter-plan confict will reduce  confusion as you move forward in developing and managing a commu- nity that is less vulnerable to the efects of natural hazards. Prioritizing  areas of high vulnerability (vulnerability hot spots), areas receiving little  policy attention (policy cool spots) or that have a lot of policies likely to  increase risk (policy hot spots), and areas of policy-vulnerability mismatch will help focus attention and resources on the places that are most in  need. Better-informed staf, decisionmakers, stakeholders, and com- munity members can work together to efectively advance the cause of  resilience. The scorecard can also be used to help your community monitor its  progress in advancing resilience. By periodically reevaluating your net- work of plans and comparing your scorecard results to those achieved  previously, you can confrm that you are on the right trackor discover  that you are heading in the wrong direction and work to change course.

On the Risk Matrix, list  infrastructural featuressuch as housing, commercial  buildings, roads, and utilitiesthat have been or could  be affected by the Top Hazards. Identify those that have  withstood, could withstand, and/or are critical to maintain  and improve. Examples: Communications systems, evacu- ation signage, and emergency operating centers.

Add information about who  owns or has responsibility for each feature listed.  Examples: City, county, state, private, association, depart- ment, agency, and corporate. (iv) Identify each feature as vulnerability or strength.  Assign each listed feature with V or S, or both. In some  cases, a community feature is both a vulnerability and  strength. Example: One municipality identified a pond as  a strength and vulnerability because it served as a water  source for the community, yet posed a flooding risk to  adjacent homes and a church if not drawn down prior to  major rainstorms. Examples of Vulnerabilities:   Main road floods during storms, blocking emergency response.  Power outages during heat waves lead to health concerns.  Wildfire and high winds resulting in supply chain interruptions.  Sewer pump stations become submerged and inoperable.  Compromised rail system due to heat-related warping of tracks. Examples of Strengths:   Critical road elevated and passable by emergency management.  Hurricane roof installed at school with improved sheltering capacity.  Hardened utility lines reduce outages due to ice storms.  Undersized culvert replaced to reduce flooding in key intersection.  Improvement to communication systems during extreme weather.

Social vulnerability is a combination of the factors and forces that affect the susceptibility of various groups within a commu- nity to harm as well as their collective ability to respond positively after extreme event and/or more routine, ongoing hazards.  Social vulnerability involves such factors as the availability of health care services and access to lifelines (food/water, emer- gency response personnel, etc.). Social strengths are often represented by those support networks that connect and main- tain the supply of goods and services to impacted groups within the community. The objective of this step is to identify  the people, places, and services that are at risk from the Top Hazards as well as those that currently add strength to the  communities overall resilience. 2 (i) List societal features. On the Risk Matrix, list societal  features. Consider factors that affect the ability of groups  to deal with adverse impacts from hazards. Conversely,  consider factors or characteristics that increase the capa- bility of groups to negate, withstand, and quickly recover  from hazards.

Legibly mark the location on the community  basemap provided. Examples: Is a population of elderly  residents located in a particularly high-hazard area? Are  other services such as gas stations, supermarkets, data  server facilitates, critical hospital care units, pharmacies,  churches, emergency command centers, shelters, public  works facilities, and fire stations located in vulnerable  locations? (iii) Identify ownership. Add information about who  owns or has responsibility for each feature listed. Exam- ple: Senior population may live in retirement communities  (private) or senior housing (public). (iv) Identify each feature as vulnerability or strength.  Assign each listed feature with V or S, or both. Examples of Vulnerabilities:   Senior housing without back-up generators during heat waves.  Residents without access transportation during hurricane evacuation.  Household contaminate and sewage mobilization during flooding.  Limited areas of refuge in elementary schools during tornados. Examples of Strengths:   Reliable communications protocols across departments for all employees.  Neighbor-helping-neighbor program aligned with emergency operations.  Well-supported volunteer organizations (fire, ambulance, CERTs).  Faith-based and civic groups with hazard preparedness plans.

In  addition to describing the standards, the report outlines a  voluntary procedure for APA recognition of comprehensive  plans that achieve defined levels of quality for inclusion of  sustainability best practices.  COMPREHENSIVE PLAN STANDARDS FOR  SUSTAINING PLACES The comprehensive plan standards are organized into a  framework of related components: (1) six principles, (2) two  processes, and (3) two attributes. Each of these components  is implemented through a set of best practices. Collectively,  these principles, processes, attributes, and supporting best  practices define what the comprehensive plan for sustaining  places should do. Principles are normative statements of intent that under- lie a plans overall strategy, including its goals, objective, poli- cies, maps, and other content. The six principles are: 1. Livable Built Environment: Ensure that all elements of  the built environmentincluding land use, transporta- tion, housing, energy, and infrastructurework together  to provide sustainable, green places for living, working,  and recreating, with a high quality of life.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARYSUSTAINING PLACES: BEST PRACTICES FOR COMPREHENSIVE PLANS PAS 578, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY www.planning.org AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION 3 2. Harmony with Nature: Ensure that the contributions of  natural resources to human well-being are explicitly rec- ognized and valued and that maintaining their health is a  primary objective. 3. Resilient Economy: Ensure that the community is pre- pared to deal with both positive and negative changes in  its economic health and to initiate sustainable urban de- velopment and redevelopment strategies that foster green  business growth and build reliance on local assets.  4. Interwoven Equity: Ensure fairness and equity in provid- ing for the housing, services, health, safety, and livelihood  needs of all citizens and groups. 5. Healthy Community: Ensure that public health needs are  recognized and addressed through provisions for healthy  foods, physical activity, access to recreation, health care,  environmental justice, and safe neighborhoods. 6. Responsible Regionalism: Ensure that all local proposals  account for, connect with, and support the plans of adja- cent jurisdictions and the surrounding region. Processes are planning activities that take place during  the preparation of a comprehensive plan and define how it  will be implemented. The two processes are: 7. Authentic Participation: Ensure that the planning pro- cess actively involves all segments of the community in  analyzing issues, generating visions, developing plans,  and monitoring outcomes. 8. Accountable Implementation: Ensure that responsibilities  for carrying out the plan are clearly stated, along with met- rics for evaluating progress in achieving desired outcomes. Attributes are plan-making design standards that shape  the content and characteristics of comprehensive plans. The  two attributes are: 9. Consistent Content: Ensure that the plan contains a con- sistent set of visions, goals, policies, objectives, and actions  that are based on evidence about community conditions,  major issues, and impacts. 10. Coordinated Characteristics: Ensure that the plan in- cludes creative and innovative strategies and recommen- dations and coordinates them internally with each other,  vertically with federal and state requirements, and hori- zontally with plans of adjacent jurisdictions", "1616": "Resilience: The increasing frequency and impacts of natural  disasters, as well as severe economic downturns, have high- lighted the need for communities to become more resilient in other words, they need the ability to recover from distur- bance and change.", "1617": "Adaptation: Conditions that used to be considered stable, such  as the climate, resource availability and costs, and the local em- ployment base, are increasingly subject to forces beyond the con- trol of local governments.

Livable Built Environment Ensure that all elements of the built environment, including  land use, transportation, housing, energy, and infrastruc- ture, work together to provide sustainable, green places for  living, working, and recreation, with a high quality of life. The built environment encompasses physical features  (such as buildings, streets, and utilities) and the systems and  processes associated with them (such as movement of people,  flow of water). As such, it defines the multifaceted community  that people experience through their daily livesthe places  where they live, work, and recreate. Because the built environ- ment shapes quality of life for the entire population, sustain- ing its livability and ensuring that it functions at the highest  possible level are primary tasks for comprehensive planning.  Traditional comprehensive plans typically treat the different  components of the built environment as separate elements,  such as land use and transportation. However, the built en- vironment is a complex system made up of many interacting  and dynamic elements, and planners face ongoing challenges  in sustaining and coordinating the overall system as well as  its component parts. By virtue of its scope and mandate, the  comprehensive plan is the logical tool for an integrated sys- tems approach to ensuring a livable built environment.", "1624": "Best practices in support of the Livable Built Envi- ronment principle include the following (see Appendix B  for definitions): 1.1 Plan for multimodal transportation. 1.2 Plan for transit-oriented development. 1.3 Coordinate regional transportation investments  with job clusters. 1.4 Provide complete streets serving multiple functions. 1.5 Plan for mixed land-use patterns that are walkable  and bikeable. 1.6 Plan for infill development. 1.7 Encourage design standards appropriate to the  community context. 1.8 Provide accessible public facilities and spaces. 1.9 Conserve and reuse historic resources. 1.10 Implement green building design and  energy conservation. 1.11 Discourage development in hazard zones.", "1625": "2.

Human well-being depends upon  a healthy natural environment to provide the services of  nourishing food, breathable air, drinkable water, haz- ard protection, energy, and spiritual sustenance. Because  urban development and human activities can disturb  natures balance and damage the resources it provides,  comprehensive plans and implementation programs must  monitor the health of and mitigate negative impacts to the  natural environment. A healthy environment is a common  resource that belongs to everyone but is owned by no one.  Therefore, the community through its plan must advocate  for, and present the value of, the contributions of natural  systems and services to the triple bottom line (environ- ment, economy, and equity). While some natural resourc- es are protected through separate functional plans, such  as those for air and water quality, the comprehensive plan  is the proper tool for the overall coordination and main- tenance of natural systems within the full community and  regional context. This includes integrating natural features  and processes into the built environment (the Livable Built  Environment principle).", "1627": "Best practices in support of the Harmony with Nature  principle include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 2.1 Restore, connect, and protect natural habitats  and sensitive lands. 2.2 Plan for the provision and protection of  green infrastructure. 2.3 Encourage development that respects  natural topography. 2.4 Enact policies to reduce carbon footprints. 2.5 Comply with state and local air quality standards. 2.6 Encourage climate change adaptation. 2.7 Provide for renewable energy use. 2.8 Provide for solid waste reduction. 2.9 Encourage water conservation and plan for a last- ing water supply. 2.10 Protect and manage streams, watersheds, and  floodplains.", "1628": "3. Resilient Economy Ensure that the community is prepared to deal with both  positive and negative changes in its economic health and  to initiate sustainable urban development and redevelop- ment strategies that foster green business growth and build  reliance on local assets.

Economic health is critical  in providing jobs and incomes to support the community; as  it rises or falls, so do the livelihoods of people. Because local  economies depend upon outside (regional, national, and even  global) inputs and trends, their employment base is affected  not only by local business formation and activity but also by  the decisions of distant firms or governments. Therefore, more  reliance on local assets increases the economic resilience of  the community, as well as contributing to place-based revi- talization. Because some productive activities generate nega- tive impacts, green businesses (such as solar-powered energy  systems) may be preferable to those with greater impacts  and can reduce reliance on outside resources (imported fos- sil fuels, for example). Although some communities develop  and implement separate economic development strategies,  the comprehensive plan provides the instrument for placing  those strategies within the context of the broader community  development agenda.", "1630": "Best practices in support of the Resilient Economy prin- ciple include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 3.1 Provide the physical capacity for economic growth. 3.2 Plan for a balanced land-use mix for  fiscal sustainability. 3.3 Plan for transportation access to  employment centers. 3.4 Promote green businesses and jobs. 3.5 Encourage community-based economic  development and revitalization. 3.6 Provide and maintain infrastructure capacity in line  with growth or decline demands. 3.7 Plan for post-disaster economic recovery.", "1631": "Best practices in support of the Resilient Economy prin- ciple include the following (see Appendix B for definitions): 3.1 Provide the physical capacity for economic growth. 3.2 Plan for a balanced land-use mix for  fiscal sustainability. 3.3 Plan for transportation access to  employment centers. 3.4 Promote green businesses and jobs. 3.5 Encourage community-based economic  development and revitalization. 3.6 Provide and maintain infrastructure capacity in line  with growth or decline demands. 3.7 Plan for post-disaster economic recovery.", "1632": "4. Interwoven Equity  Ensure fairness and equity in providing for the housing,  services, health, safety, and livelihood needs of all citizens  and groups. Equity in the provision of community decisions and  services involves the fair distribution of benefits and  costs. It results from applying basic fairness tests that  ask whether the needs of the full range of the popula- tion servedrich and poor, young and old, native and  immigrantare served. Because disadvantaged, young,  or immigrant populations often do not participate in de- bates over community policies and programs, their needs ", "1633": "may fail to be recognized. Poor, underserved, and minor- ity populations are often disproportionately affected by  polluting land uses and natural disasters.

Public participation in planning is a mainstay of demo- cratic governance and decision making. By actively involving  the whole community in making and implementing plans, the  government fulfills its responsibilities to keep all citizens in- formed and to offer them the opportunity to influence those  actions that affect them. In the past, public participation  processes did not necessarily reach all segments of the com- munity and may have been viewed by public agencies more  as a requirement to meet (for example, by conducting public  hearings) than as an opportunity to garner meaningful input.  This means that authentic participation processes may have to  overcome the perception that what participants say will not be  respected. Authentic participation programs go beyond the  minimum legal requirements to connect with citizens through  innovative communication and outreach channels, such as  creative use of the Internet and interactive workshops in loca- tions where people work and live.

Traditional comprehensive plans have  been subject to criticism because they do not connect goals  and policies to actual implementation, with the possible  exception of revising zoning and development regula- tions. By contrast, accountable implementation weaves the  plan into the daily activities of the local jurisdiction and  its various departments, including budgeting and capital  program funding. The most effective programs reach out- side the local government to engage partners in the public,  private, and nonprofit sectors in implementation. Because  the public is often unaware of the effectiveness of actions  taken to carry out the plan, an accountable implementa- tion program establishes and regularly publishes metrics  that report on progress; the relevant adage is what gets  measured, gets done.

The benefit of this scoring is to provide an indication of the  degree to which the plan takes a comprehensive approach  to sustaining places. By assessing the level of achievement  for the practices in the standards, reviewers will be able to  judge the overall quality of the plan. As mentioned earlier,  this assessment may be done internally within the com- munity to generate a comparative benchmark of the plans  achievement versus the full slate of possible best practices.  In the future, it may also be offered through an external re- view and designation process (see Appendix D). This report  focuses on internal scoring. As noted in Chapter 2, the scoring approach involves as- signing a rating of Not Applicable, Not Present, Low, Medi- um, or High to a plans incorporation of each practice in the  standards framework. To assist planners in scoring, a matrix  has been prepared with brief descriptions of the practices as- sociated with each principle, process, and attribute. A copy of  this matrix is located in Appendix C. To ensure that the scoring is accurate as possible, a  team of at least two planners knowledgeable about the  plans structure and content should carry out the scoring  separately. Once each team member has read and scored the  plan, they can meet to identify and discuss differences in  scoring, including any judgment calls made about the level  at which a particular practice should be scored. This should  be continued until the team is able to come to consensus on  the scoring. What will the final scores tell communities? The scores  will identify any areas where the plan departs from the level  of plan quality set forth in the standards framework. They  will highlight areas of strength and areas where further im- provement may be warranted. If a plan has a high overall  score, then a community can be assured that they are staking  their future sustainability on a strong planning foundation. If  it has a low overall score, then this can help a community un- derstand the need to invest further resources in its planning  program.

Its a good idea to start the sustainability planning process as soon as possible.  Identifying and agreeing on a process, including a timetable is very important. When developing your time- line, consider the size and technological capacity (e.g., e-mail, Web access, use of social media) of your group.  Try to ensure that each members role in the group properly reflects his or her skills, interests, and resources.  And decide when in-person meetings are essential and when virtual meetings can be used instead.", "1688": "Start by identifying what your coalition is already doing to plan for sustainability; some of these strategies  might already be in your coalitions community action plan (CAP).", "1689": "Think about current and future goals and factors such as infrastructure, operational practices, and financial re- sources needed to support those goals. (For a full list of other factors to consider, see Activity B in the Appen- dix on page 88). Assess partner relationships that support coalition efforts and identify those you may want to  develop. For coalitions just beginning their plan, ask members, external stakeholders, local groups, and com- munity members to fill out a connection mapa catalog of existing and potential community connections.  (See the HCC example on page 21). When looking for support and resources (e.g., funding, in-kind support,  people) to help achieve and sustain organizational or policy goals, consider using all or some of the assets and  connections available. Then review the maps with appropriate individuals to find any potential sustainability  connections; they may be willing to make the initial contact for you. (Be sure you get prior approval to use  any newly established connections). If youre not sure what a new organization can bring to the table, find the  right people from that organization and interview them to determine their interests and potential resources.  Another way to use the maps is to identify gaps among particular groups in the community.

Then list pending items/up- coming events (e.g., pending funding, policy changes, new initiatives) that can  impact continuation of those efforts. Work with members outside the planning  team to ensure that youve included all pending items. It might also be help- ful to list other community efforts that could complement or duplicate your  coalition strategies and activities. Finally, if you havent already, discuss how all  these factors influence the current organizational structure and the potential  for achieving future policy strategies, goals, objectives, or activities. This analy- sis can help your coalition leverage funding and partnershipswhich, in turn,  positively impacts sustainability succes", "1705": "Focus on Money or Effort? These important issues are linked. Most groups begin to work on sustainability because a funding source is  ending. They often focus so much on replacing that funding, they dont question whether or not the policy  strategy is worth sustaining (St. Leger, 2005). What is its value? Does it have community buy-in and support?  Do leaders see its outcome as important? Conversely, have effective policy strategies been successfully imple- mented and no longer need your groups attention? Or do existing strategies need monitoring or enforcing? In  addition, are there funders who will support your objectives? Do you have a case statement to promote your  efforts? Asking these questions before beginning sustainability discussions can help lead to informed choices  about whether a policy strategy and activity should be continued and, if so, in what form.  When developing these criteria, consider your coalitions mission and vision, how the group is structured and  supported, as well as the long-term goal of each of your policy efforts. The Sustainability Planning Team should  agree on criteria that will help determine the value-added benefit of each effort, and select those for which  data are available.  Potential criteria include: available resources (financial, organizational, human), level of community support,  evidence of strategy effectiveness, and whether a need still exists for the effort in question. (See Step 5 in the  HCC example on page 25). Determine whether any of these criteria are relevant to your coalitions situation. To  make the rating process easier, consider selecting only 35 of the most important criteria. (For more detailed  instructions on how to use criteria to prioritize activities, see the Activity D Criteria Grid in the Appendix on  page 93). It is also important to ensure a direct relationship between  coalition goals and the supporting objectives and activities.  Objectives should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,  Relevant, and Time-bound). Coalitions should view objectives as  short- or long-term strategies. For example, a coalition can fund  a strategy as part of a demonstration project (short-term) to  successfully make the case for a future policy goal (long-term).  Or, you may fund the development of three community gardens  in underserved areas, but ultimately want to create a policy  distributing garden produce to local food banks in the area on a  regular basis.", "1706": "Evaluation data can help your coalition: improve implementation over time; increase accountability to funders  (now and in the future); promote sustainability, and engage stakeholders. First youll need to choose the best  way of gathering needed datae.g., interviews, focus groups, surveys, site visits? Remember, some of the  evaluation data you use can come from other sources, such as, national and state surveys, and organizational  and historical data. Below are a few evaluation tips to keep in mind throughout the sustainability process.    Develop a logic model that shows how continuing strategies will help improve community outcomes.  For an example of a logic model, see Example 2 in the Appendix on page 98.    Survey coalition members and other relevant decision-makers to determine if your current organiza- tion is helping to make the most of community resources to achieve its goals.    Instead of just counting numbers, explain an efforts return on social investment. For example, show  how strategies might help save lives (Ralser, 2007). In a report by Trust for Americas Health (TFAH),  an investment of $10 per person per year in proven community-based strategies to increase physical  activity, improve nutrition, and prevent smoking and other tobacco use could save the country more  than $16 billion annually within 5 years (Braveman & Egerter, 2008).   Use short-term results to make the case for or support how this strategy will have long-term benefits.    Involve evaluators early in sustainability discussions to provide key data for decision making.   If an effort is based on a similar activity evaluated elsewhere, those findings may help make the case  for your work and sharpen decisions about which activities to continue. Consider using CDCs Commu- nity Health Assessment and Group Evaluation (CHANGE) tool to gain a better picture of current coali- tion activities.
